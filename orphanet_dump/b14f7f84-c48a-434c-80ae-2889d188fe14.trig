Infection occurs through ingestion of contaminated food or water and leads to abdominal pain, anorexia and diarrhoea, which may resolve spontaneously in immunocompetent individuals but may persist in a chronic form in immunocompromised subjects, leading to a decline in their general state of health." ;
