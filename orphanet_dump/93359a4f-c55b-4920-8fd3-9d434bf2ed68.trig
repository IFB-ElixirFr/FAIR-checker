        ns1:description "Mucinous tubular and spindle cell renal carcinoma is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma characterized, histologically, by tubular architecture and sheets of spindle cells embedded in a mucinous/myxoid stroma and, macroscopically, by a solid, generally well-circumscribed, partially encapsulated tumor of variable size, with a homogenously colored, bulging cut surface, occassionally containing areas of hemorrhage or necrosis, usually located in the cortex. Patients can present abdominal/flank pain, adbominal mass and/or hematuria, however most are asymptomatic and tumor is discovered incidentally. Indolent behavior is frequent and association with nephrolithiasis and end-stage kidney disease has been noted." ;
