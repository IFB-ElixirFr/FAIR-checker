        ns1:description "A rare head and neck tumor characterized by an epithelial neoplasm with evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation, typically located in the supraglottic larynx. The tumor can be well, moderately, or poorly differentiated, the latter group being subdivided into small cell or large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. There is a strong association with tobacco use. Patients present with hoarseness, dysphagia, sore throat, airway obstruction, hemoptysis, and rarely a paraneoplastic syndrome due to aberrant hormone production. Poorly differentiated tumors are highly aggressive with high rates of regional and distant metastasis." ;
