        ns1:description "Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis usually observed in temperate climates and that typically develops in middle-aged to elderly males. CAD is characterized by eczematous and often lichenified pruritic patches and confluent plaques located predominantly on sun-exposed areas with notable sparing of eyelids, skin folds, and postauricular skin. It is often accompanied by multiple contact allergies and usually occurs in a background of either atopic, contact allergic, or seborrheic dermatitis, although it can occur <i>de novo</i>. Resolution of photosensitivity is reported in up to 50% of individuals after 15 years or more, with contact allergies persisting." ;
