        ns1:description "A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a slow-growing, usually painless, subcutaneous nodule, predominantly located in the extremities, less frequently the trunk or head and neck region. Histopathologically, the lesion is well-circumscribed, lobulated, and composed of epitheloid, ovoid, or spindle cells arranged in a nodular and often syncytial pattern, with pseudoangiomatoid spaces and a peripheral fibrous pseudocapsule with a prominent lymphoplasmacytic cuff. The tumor is most common in the first two decades of life and usually follows an indolent course, although local recurrence may occur, while metastasis is rare." ;
