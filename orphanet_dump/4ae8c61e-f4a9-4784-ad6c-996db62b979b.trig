        ns1:description "A rare infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by infancy-onset of myoclonic seizures in otherwise neurologically and developmentally normal patients. Jerks may vary in severity, can be singular or occur in a series, and occur spontaneously or (less commonly) after sensory stimuli. Seizures are self-limiting and remit within several months to years from onset, although generalized tonic-clonic seizures or other forms of epilepsy may be seen later in life. Developmental delay and cognitive and behavioral difficulties have been reported in a considerable percentage of patients." ;
