        ns1:description "Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare small intestinal malignancy, most commonly located in the duodenum (55% of cases) but also rarely in the jejunum and ileum, which is usually discovered at an advanced stage in the 6th to 7th decade of life due to non-specific symptoms at presentation such as nausea, abdominal pain and weight loss. In some cases it is asymptomatic, and therefore usually has a poor prognosis." ;
