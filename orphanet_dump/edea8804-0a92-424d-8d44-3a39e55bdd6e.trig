        ns1:description "A rare subtype of congenital pulmonary airway malformation characterized by a multicystic mass of non-functioning lung tissue, consisting of small cysts of less than 2 cm in diameter. The lesions have intracystic communications, can be connected to the tracheobronchial tree, and are usually unilateral, involving a single lobe. The condition often presents with respiratory distress in the neonatal period or in infancy. It is frequently associated with other severe congenital anomalies, such as renal agenesis or dysgenesis, pulmonary sequestration, or cardiac abnormalities." ;
