The category includes double-hit cases with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, blastoid cases with a double-hit, and cases with a DLBCL, not otherwise specified, morphology with a double-hit. It refers only to <i>de novo</i> cases, not to lymphomas with a history of pre-existing or coexistent indolent lymphoma. Patients typically present with widespread disease, including involvement of lymph nodes, bone marrow, and central nervous system." ;
