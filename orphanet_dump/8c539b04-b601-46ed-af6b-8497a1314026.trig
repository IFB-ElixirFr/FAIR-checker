        ns1:description "Persistent placoid maculopathy is characterised by white plaque-like lesions involving the macula but sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes. It has been described in five patients. In contrast to patients with macular serpiginous choroiditis presenting with similar lesions, the five patients reported so far with persistent placoid maculopathy had good visual acuity until the onset of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or pigmentary mottling. The macular lesions fade after several months or years, but the vascular anomalies persist leading to a loss of central vision." ;
