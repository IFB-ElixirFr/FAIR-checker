        ns1:description "Congenital absence of both forearm and hand is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by unilateral or bilateral arrest of proximal to distal development of the upper limb, leading to a transverse deficiency with absence of the forearm, wrist and hand. A short below-the-elbow amputation is most commonly observed and the residual limb is usually well cushioned, with rudimentary nubbins or dumpling possibly found on the end." ;
