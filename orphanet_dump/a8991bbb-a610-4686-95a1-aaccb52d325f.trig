Skeletal findings include short stature, anomalies of the long bones, hands and feet, and pelvis, platyspondyly, cervical malformation, and pectus excavatum. Dysmorphic facial features, such as coarse face, hypertelorism, and broad nasal tip, may be present. Additional reported manifestations are seizures, hyperreflexia, nystagmus, and muscular hypotonia, as well as multiple liver cysts." ;
