Onset usually occurs 2-8 weeks after administration of the causal medication and is most frequently associated with anticonvulsants, antibacterial sulfonamides and allopurinol but many other medications have also been implicated. Histology is characterized by interface dermatitis, sometimes mixed with eczematous and an acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis-like pattern. Auto-immune sequelae may occur." ;
