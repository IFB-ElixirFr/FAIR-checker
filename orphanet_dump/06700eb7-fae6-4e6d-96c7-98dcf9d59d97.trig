        ns1:description "A rare bone disease characterized by avascular necrosis of a metatarsal head, most commonly involving the second, but also the third or fourth, metatarsal. Patients may present with pain on weight-bearing, swelling, and tenderness. Radiological features include widening of the metatarsophalangeal joint space and flattening of the affected metatarsal head, at later stages metatarsal head sclerosis, cortical thickening, and intra-articular loose bodies. The condition can be bilateral in some cases and shows a significant predilection for females in the second or third decade of life." ;
