Patients typically present with upper abdominal pain and severe iron deficiency anemia. The condition is not commonly associated with autoimmune diseases, and involvement of the colon is less frequent than in the adult form. The disease takes a generally benign course with limited long-term morbidity and no increased mortality." ;
