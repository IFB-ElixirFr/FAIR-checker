Web tool to assess FAIR principles and promote their implementation.

##Monitoring progress in FAIRification through self-assessment of resources maturity indicators

This demo is based on the FAIRMetrics framework [Wilkinson, Dumontier et al., Scientific Data 6:174] that is composed of Maturity Indicators (MI), compliance tests and the evaluator application itself. For now, few efforts have been done so far to take advantage from their concrete implementation, in the process of improving FAIRness of users/community resources. Furthermore, this does not provide concrete help or guidelines to developers for better sharing their published works. In this work we propose a web demonstrator, leveraging existing web APIs, aimed at i) evaluating FAIR maturity indicators and ii) providing hints to progress in the FAIRification process.
