Knowledge on their distribution and population dynamics increases our understanding of processes driving disease transmission. This is the first study using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to elucidate the population genetic structure of the hermaphroditic snail Bulinus truncatus (Gastropoda, Heterobranchia) on a regional (17 to 150 km) and an inter-regional (1,000 – 5,400 km) scale. This snail species acts as an intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, which cause human and animal schistosomiasis respectively. \\nMethods: Bulinus truncatus snails were collected in Senegal, Cameroon, Egypt and France and identified through DNA barcoding. A single-end Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) library, comprising of 87 snail specimens from the respective countries, was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped against S....', 'Samples of\\xa0B. truncatus\\xa0(numbers of specimens ranging from four to 16 per locality) were collected from 2011 to 2014 in Cameroon (one site, Cam_BAK), Senegal (four sites, Sen_DIAM, Sen_GUEC, Sen_MBO, Sen_NDO), Egypt (two sites, Egy_BEK, Egy_MAN) and France (one site, Cor_SUT).\\nA single-end GBS reduced representation library (RRL) was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center). The library was prepared by digesting DNA with EcoT22I, ligating P1 and P2 Illumina sequencing primers (the former including molecular identifiers for sequence demultiplexing) and Illumina adapters, before proceeding with titration and library enrichment. The choice of the restriction enzyme followed preliminary comparisons between EcoT22I and PstI on representatives of\\xa0B. truncatus.\\nHTS data processing\\nThe\\xa0HiSeq run produced 257x106\\xa0single-end raw reads of 101 bp.

Determination of climate change effects on community stability, however, requires long-term studies of structure and underlying dynamics, including bottom-up and top-down effects in natural ecosystems. Although relevant datasets were rare in the early years of community ecology, such information has increased in recent decades. In a rocky intertidal system, we investigated the changes in ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, prey colonization), several performance metrics of the dominant space occupier (mussels) and its primary predator (sea stars), and rate of predation by sea stars on mussels in relation to climatic oscillations, temperature, and disease. We focused on spatio-temporal changes in the mean and variability of these metrics. The research protocol involved annually repeated multiyear (~1999–2018), multisite (13 si...', 'Climate measures (NPGO, ENSO, PDO) and upwelling (CUTI) indices were downloaded from websites given in the paper. Temperature data were collected in situ with dataloggers. Mussel and barnacle colonization, mussel growth/reproduction/condition index, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, sea star reproduction rate and sea star predation rate data were collected as noted in the paper using observations and experiments.

Yet, little is known on how downstream eDNA dispersal is affected by the combination of river discharge and source biomass effects. In this study, we aimed at unravelling the effect of source- and system-specific processes on the stream reach of eDNA. We used a longitudinal cage study in two river sections characterized by a significantly different discharge rate, where two invasive and two native fish species were introduced under two contrasting biomass treatments. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses, we found that eDNA concentrations become strongly reduced 2 km downstream from the source, an effect that is strengthened with increasing river discharge and coinciding dilution effects. Higher discharge rates resulted in equal or even higher d...', '', 'Treatments\\xa0\\nOverview of the different fish abundances as used in the nets between the two biomass treatmenst as well as the two different river sections.\\nAbiotics\\nOverview of the characterization of the study system.

The boundary layer height (BLH) evolution mechanism across the iCMV has not yet been fully understood. We use Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations and ceilometer measurements to decipher the iCMV BLH evolution mechanism during the late summertime period of 5-14 September 2017, where the daily maximum BLH at the mountainous city of Jerusalem (JrM; 800m above sea-level) varies by ~1000m. We first verify the BLH, simulated by 5 model configurations (with 4 different BL schemes). The RMSE for the 3 best configurations are around 160 and 200m for the coastal and JrM areas, respectively. An analysis of the simulated daily BL evolution reveals a general mechanism. In the early morning, the up-slope flows and synoptic forcing interact to induce a surface flow convergence (SFC) zone.

Thus far, little information has documented the adaptability and evolvability of traits related to drought and pests simultaneously. We conducted common-garden experiments to investigate how several phenotypic traits (i.e., height growth, drought avoidance based on water-use efficiency inferred from δ13C, and pest resistance based on defense traits) interact in five mature lodgepole pine populations established in four progeny trials in western Canada. The relevance of interpopulation variation in climate sensitivity highlighted that seed-source warm populations had greater adaptive capability than cold populations. In test sites, warming generated taller trees with higher δ13C and increased the evolutionary potential of height growth and δ13C across populations.

Clarifying the role of construction behavior on a macroevolutionary scale is crucial to interpreting phenotypic evolution. Spiders, an extremely successful group of animals exhibiting a wide variety of functional, morphological, and behavioral diversity, are ideal candidates to test whether animal behaviors are related to their phenotypic evolution. Herein, we reconstructed the phylogenomic relationships of 303 spiders covering 105 families with 99 newly developed molecular markers that universally apply across Araneae, and explicitly tested the potential link between construction behavior and somatic evolution based on extensive morphological data from 3,342 extant species and 682 fossil species. Our dated molecular phylogeny provides the backbone for analyses, revealing the behavioral and ecological processes behind these spiders’ morphological adaptations.

Historically these metapopulations persisted as relatively fluid networks, enabling gene flow between subpopulations and recolonization of formerly extirpated regions. However, over the past 45 years, Allegheny woodrat populations have experienced population declines throughout their range due to a combination of habitat destruction, declining hard mast availability, and roundworm parasitism. In an effort to initiate genetic rescue of a small, genetically depauperate subpopulation in New Jersey, woodrats were translocated from a genetically robust population in Pennsylvania (PA) in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Herein, we assess the efficacy of these translocations to restore genetic diversity within the recipient population.\\xa0\\nResults: We designed a novel 134 single nucleotide polymorphism panel, which was used to genotype the six woodrats translocated fro...', 'We extracted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a tail clip of a single N. magister individual by pairing commercially available extraction (DNEasy Blood and Tissue, Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands and clean-up (DNA clean &amp; Concentrator, Zymo Research, Irvine, California) kits in accord with the manufacturers’ instructions. We conducted three lanes of paired-end and one lane of mate-paired sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq2500. We used Trimmomatic to remove adaptors, discard short reads, and trim poor-quality bases from 5’ and 3’ ends of raw sequence reads. We used ABySS 1.9.0 to conduct several assemblies with kmer lengths ranging from 40 to 85. PE reads were used to generate contigs. MP reads were used to infer the order, orientation, and distance between contigs, linking them together in scaffolds. The assembly with the greatest N50 value and longest scaffold was used for downstream analyses.\\nWe used the MAKER 2.28 pipeline to annotate all scaffolds greater than 10 kb. We first use...', 'The Neotoma magister draft genome was generated from mate-paired and paired-end reads using ABySS vs. 1.9.0.\\xa0 The scaffolds greater than 10 kb in length are described in the 10000_kmer70_scaffolds_woodrats.fasta file.\\n21,151 genes were annotated in the N. magister genome.

However, a molecular dissection of their effect on females is rare. In decorated crickets, the male’s nuptial gift comprises part of the male’s spermatophore, the spermatophylax, which functions to deter the female from prematurely removing the sperm-containing portion, the ampulla, from her genital opening. However, ingested spermatophylax compounds and proteins contained in the ampulla could also influence female physiology and behavior to the male’s benefit. We investigated how mating per se and these two distinct routes of potential male-mediated manipulation influence the transcriptional response of females. We conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment on the gut and head tissue from females for whom consumption of nuptial food gifts and receipt of an ejaculate had been independently manipulated. In the gut tissue, we found that females not permitt...', 'Transcriptomes were assembled with Trinity and sare deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the bioproject PRJNA784797.\\xa0\\nThey were annotated using the Trinotate pipeline.

Mangroves reach a southern global range limit along the South African coastline, but the distribution is patchy, with stands occurring in only 16% of the estuaries in the region. Yet, the persistence of forests planted &gt;50 years ago beyond the natural distribution limit suggests that additional estuaries could support mangroves. Understanding regional drivers is necessary to inform global scale estimates for how this important ecosystem is predicted to respond to climate change.\\nHere, we combine species distribution modeling (MaxEnt), Lagrangian particle tracking using an eddy- and tide-resolving numerical ocean model, and connectivity matrices, to identify suitable mangrove habitats at present, as well as under the IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios.\\nWithin the current South African distribution range (± 900 km), eight more estuaries ...', 'Mangrove data\\nMangroves occur in 31 of the 192 estuaries along the eastern South African coast, over a tropical to warm-temperate biogeographical transition zone (latitudinal range of 26°53’42.6’’ – 33°13’32.8’’ S). Data for mangrove area cover (ha) in South African estuaries were collated from the National Estuarine Botanical Database (updated in 2019) (http://bgis.sanbi.org/SpatialDataset/Detail/2687) (Adams &amp; Rajkaran, 2021).\\nEnvironmental data\\nFor the development of species distribution models (SDMs), environmental data are needed from the occurrence locations (as part of the background data), as well as from locations where mangroves do not occur (as part of the landscape data). As mangroves are restricted to estuaries, only environmental data from estuaries (and not areas along the open coast) were included in the model.\\nThe estuarine environmental drivers of mangrove distribution along the South African coastline have previously been identified by Raw et al.

The purpose of this study was to use reanalysis and satellite data similar to those used in global and regional dust emission models to calculate the probability that a high wind event happens during the period that antecedent precipitation would have left the active layer wet. The results indicate that the answer to this question is more strongly related to regional climate than soil texture. For more than half of the globe with mean annual precipitation &lt; 500 mm/year, the probability of precipitation influencing dust emission is greater than 30 – 40%. Thus, rain-derived soil moisture in the active layer should not be ignored in models throughout much of the world’s dust-producing regions.', 'A global map of sand, silt, and clay fractions was derived from the global WISE v. 3.1 30 x 30 arcsec database which is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database [Batjes, 2016]. For each cell of this dataset, there are up to nine different soil components. For each cell, percent sand, silt and clay were derived by calculating the average of all available components, weighted by their fractional area in the cell. These average fractions were resampled to 0.25° x 0.25°, the same resolution as the precipitation data, and drying time was calculated using Equation 1.\\xa0\\nRavi et al. [2006] conducted experiments on six soils that provide estimates of the time it takes the active layer to dry (i.e., for a wet surface to return come into equilibrium with ambient relative humidity). A parameterization for these drying times (DTs) for soils based on soil texture data created by regressing DT against fractions of sand, silt, and clay:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DT (minutes) = 15.95 % Sand + 28.05 % Silt + 20....', 'Data are in TIFF/GeoTIFF Format and can be opened in standard image processing (for remote sensing data) or GIS (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) software.

Consequently, plant species have acquired traits that allow them to resist and regenerate in an environment with recurrent fires. A key trait in fire-prone ecosystems is the age at first reproduction (maturity age); populations of non-resprouting species cannot persist when fire interval is shorter than this age. Maturity age is variable among individuals, so we hypothesize that short fire intervals select for early seed production (precocity). We selected 13 plots with different fire regimes in eastern Spain, all dominated by Pinus halepensis (a non-resprouting serotinous species). Then, we evaluated the age at first reproduction and the size of the canopy seed bank of each individual pine. Our results show a significant effect of fire regime on the onset of reproduction in this species, suggesting a selection towards higher precocity in populations subject to shorter fire intervals. Due to this higher precocity, pines stored more...', 'We selected 13 sites dominated by Pinus halepensis trees in the Valencia region (eastern Spain) across a range of altitudes and climatic conditions. In each site, we established 4 transects, spaced by at least 100 m. In each transect, we haphazardly selected and georeferenced 10 trees, separated by at least 10 m. For each tree, we measured its basal diameter (10 cm above ground) and the distance to the two closest trees. Then, we compute the annual growth rate as the basal diameter (cm) divided by the age (years) and the average of the distances to the 2 closest trees. Afterward, we estimated the age of each tree by counting whorls. For reproductive trees, we also estimated the age of each cone following the same method of counting whorls (avoiding immature cone cohorts; i.e., the last or last two cohorts depending on the sampling season) and recorded whether they were open (non-serotinous), closed (serotinous cones), or from the last cohort considered (closed but serotiny unknown).

An informatics framework was developed for phylogeny-based integration of these data and prediction of traits for any subject barcodes, and compared to two Blast-based methods of trait assignment.\\xa0\\nUnder the specimen-level dataset, rate and accuracy of trait assigned dropped with an increase in distance between the query and its nearest reference member, though phylogenetic assignment was found to perform best under several criteria. For a wider range of compiled traits, conservative life-history traits showing the highest rates of assignment, for example sociality was predicted with confidence at 53%, parasit...', 'For the newly created specimen-level database, morphological traits were measured using either a Motic SMZ-161-BLED stereomicroscope with an eyepiece ruler or a Zeiss Discovery V20 stereomicroscope.

Body length was measured as the distance between the antennal socket and metasomal apex in lateral view; head width was taken as the widest point between the outer margins of compound eyes in frontal view; the tongue length was the distance between the prementum base and glossa tip; hind leg length was measured as the sum of the lengths of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus (including distitarsus); ITD was measured as the distance between the nearest inner edges of the tegulae in dorsal view; the hairs on the mesonotum were used as a proxy for hair length; forewing length was recoded as the distance between wing base and anal angle.\\nIn addition to the specimen-level dataset, we collated data fo...', 'Excel'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v9s4mw703', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859249', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859263', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859264'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v9s4mw703', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Bees', 'Anthophila', ' trait', 'DNA Barcode', 'functional trait', 'Phylogenetics'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tingting Xie', 'givenName': 'Tingting', 'familyName': 'Xie', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-5770', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05tm6j853', 'name': 'Institute of Zoology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Douglas Chesters', 'givenName': 'Douglas', 'familyName': 'Chesters', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05skxkv18', 'name': 'Institute of Zoology'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v9s4mw703/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Some authors contend such divergence is concentrated along a single major axis of trait covariance, even if that axis does not lead populations directly toward fitness optimum. Other authors argue that divergence can occur readily along many phenotype axes at the same time. We use populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 14 lakes with contrasting ecological conditions to find some resolution along the continuum between these two extremes. Unlike many previous studies, we included several functional suites of traits (defensive, swimming, trophic) potentially subject to different sources of selection. We find that populations exhibit dimensionality of divergence that is high enough to preclude a history of constraint along a single axis – both for divergence in multivariate mean trai...', '', 'Please see README file'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862326', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862327', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862329', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862338', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862450', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862453', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862454'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv41xw', 'version': 6, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grant Haines', 'givenName': 'Grant', 'familyName': 'Haines', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9085-0022', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01pxwe438', 'name': 'McGill University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Hosts often learn to recognize and remove the parasitic egg from their clutch. To avoid egg rejection, brood parasites should select host nests in which the colour of the eggs best matches that of their own. Although this hypothesis has received some support, direct experimental evidence is still lacking. Here, we report on a study of Daurian redstarts (Phoenicurus auroreus), a species showing a distinct egg colour dimorphism, with females laying either blue or pink eggs. Redstarts are often parasitized by common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus), which lay light blue eggs. First, we show that cuckoo eggs were more similar in spectral reflectance to the blue than to the pink redstart egg morph. Second, we report that the natural parasitism rate was higher in blue than in pink host clutches. Third, we performed a field experiment in which we presented a dummy clutch of each colour morph close to ...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.5dv41ns8v', 'contentUrl': [], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5dv41ns8v', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jinggang Zhang', 'givenName': 'Jinggang', 'familyName': 'Zhang', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0459-0429', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/022k4wk35', 'name': 'Beijing Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Peter Santema', 'givenName': 'Peter', 'familyName': 'Santema', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00178eg98', 'name': 'Max Planck Institute for Ornithology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Zixuan Lin', 'givenName': 'Zixuan', 'familyName': 'Lin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/022k4wk35', 'name': 'Beijing Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Lixing Yang', 'givenName': 'Lixing', 'familyName': 'Yang', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/022k4wk35', 'name': 'Beijing Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Meijun Liu', 'givenName': 'Meijun', 'familyName': 'Liu', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/022k4wk35', 'name': 'Beijing Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jianqiang Li', 'givenName': 'Jianqiang', 'familyName': 'Li', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04xv2pc41', 'name': 'Beijing Forestry University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Wenhong Deng', 'givenName': 'Wenhong', 'familyName': 'Deng', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/022k4wk35', 'name': 'Beijing Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bart Kempenaers', 'givenName': 'Bart', 'familyName': 'Kempenaers', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00178eg98', 'name': 'Max Planck Institute for Ornithology'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.5dv41ns8v/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': ['2022', '2022-10-13T00:00:00Z'], 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Analysing how and why lianas are distributed in forest canopies at landscape scales will help us determine the mechanisms driving changes in lianas over time. This will improve our understanding of liana ecology and projections of tropical forest carbon storage now and into the future. Despite competing hypotheses on the mechanisms driving spatial patterning of lianas, few studies have integrated multiple tree-level biotic and abiotic factors in an analytical framework. None have done so in the Palaeotropics, which are biogeographically and evolutionarily distinct from the Neotropics, where most research on lianas has been conducted.\\nWe used an unoccupied aerial system (UAS; drone) to assess liana load in 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia.

However, temporal changes in edge permeability, which may depend on the seasonal availability of resources in both matrix and native habitats, remain poorly understood. Here we tested how edge crossing behavior and the associated spillover of birds into sun coffee plantations respond to landscape structure and seasonality. We monitored the movement of six insectivorous understory bird species (four forest-specialists and two forest-generalists) using an automated telemetry system along a gradient of forest cover (7-60%) during two seasons (dry vs. wet) at nine sampling sites at the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We monitored 116 individuals and obtained a total of 15,129 bird detections across seasons. Bird resistance to crossing edges was strongly driven by an interaction between seasonality and forest cover in the surrounding landscape, with higher resistance to crossing edges along th...', \"The data upload here encompasses the data regarding 1) the number of detections of each marked individual across automated receptors (DetectionsAcross_AutomatedReceptors.xls), and 2) the Edge Resistance Index calculated for each species (EdgeResistanceIndex.xls).

We first apply standard methods to construct a binary phylogenetic tree and then use integer linear programming to compute optimal circular orderings that agree with all tree splits. This approach achieves an improved approximation of the input distance for the clear majority of experiments that we have run for simulated and real data. We release an implementation in R that can handle up to 94 taxa and usually needs about one minute on a standard computer for 80 taxa. For larger taxa sets, we include a top-down heuristic which also tends to perform better than Neighbor-net.', 'Two parts of data were used in our paper about Lpnet algorithm.\\nRandom matrix:\\n10000 distance matrixes for 30 taxa which use random numbers between 0 and 1 from the uniform distribution as pairwise distances. And then, we add the smallest constant to all distances to guarantee the triangle inequality in every distance matrix. We provide 10000 distance matrixes.\\nSimulation sequences:\\nWe randomly generate 10000 trees for 30 taxa by using the function sim.taxa from the R package TreeSimGM. We let the parameter waiting time until speciation for sim.taxa be exponentially distributed and normalize the maximum pairwise distance to 1 for every simulation tree. Then we use the software Dawg to simulate DNA sequences of length 10000bp from the simulation trees under Jukes-Cantor model. We provide origin simulation trees, distance matrixes, and simulation sequences.', 'We upload .txt files which can be opened with any text editor.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.51c59zwc3', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858192', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858194', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858201'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.51c59zwc3', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['phylogenetic networks', 'neighbor-net', 'integer linear programming', 'Circular split systems', 'Distance-based phylogenetics'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mengzhen Guo', 'givenName': 'Mengzhen', 'familyName': 'Guo', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-6330', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00rytkh49', 'name': 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Stefan Grünewald', 'givenName': 'Stefan', 'familyName': 'Grünewald', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00rytkh49', 'name': 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.51c59zwc3/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Here, we perform GWAS of 16 metabolites clustered at the intersection of amino acid catabolism, glycolysis, and ketone body metabolism in a subset of UK Biobank. We utilize the well-documented biochemistry jointly impacting these metabolites to analyze pleiotropic effects in the context of their pathways. Among the 213 lead GWAS hits, we find a strong enrichment for genes encoding pathway-relevant enzymes and transporters. We demonstrate that the effect directions of variants acting on biology between metabolite pairs often contrast with those of upstream or downstream variants as well as the polygenic background. Thus, we find that these outlier variants often reflect biology local to the traits. Finally, we explore the implications for interpreting disease GWAS, underscoring the potential of unifying biochemistry with dense metabolomics data to understa...', 'The details of the dataset processing are provided in our manuscript: https://elifesciences.org/articles/79348\\nBriefly, we performed GWAS of technically-corrected metabolite levels from the Nightingale NMR Metabolomics dataset on 94,464 European-ancestry individuals and 98,189 individuals in our ancestry-inclusive analysis using BOLT-REML and integrated these results with a curated biochemical map connecting the 16 core metabolites spanning glycolysis, ketones, and amino acids.\\nFiles with names \"*_step3.txt\" and \"*_step2.txt\" are the local genetic correlation and local heritability estimates for each approximately independent LD block (Berisa et al. 2016) using rho-HESS (Shi et al. 2017) and HESS (Shi et al. 2016), respectively.
