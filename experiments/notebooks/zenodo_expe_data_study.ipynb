The boundary layer height (BLH) evolution mechanism across the iCMV has not yet been fully understood. We use Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations and ceilometer measurements to decipher the iCMV BLH evolution mechanism during the late summertime period of 5-14 September 2017, where the daily maximum BLH at the mountainous city of Jerusalem (JrM; 800m above sea-level) varies by ~1000m. We first verify the BLH, simulated by 5 model configurations (with 4 different BL schemes). The RMSE for the 3 best configurations are around 160 and 200m for the coastal and JrM areas, respectively. An analysis of the simulated daily BL evolution reveals a general mechanism. In the early morning, the up-slope flows and synoptic forcing interact to induce a surface flow convergence (SFC) zone.

Interactions between plants vary in space, over time and with organisational complexity. Yet it is challenging to quantify temporal, spatial and functional determinants of different types of interactions between long-lived perennial plant species and their effect on lifetime fecundity. We studied how plant-plant, pollinator- and seed predator-mediated interactions affect year-to-year variation in three fecundity components (cone production, seed set and seed survival) during post-fire recovery. Age-stratified data on the three fecundity components were collected in 19 even-aged communities comprising 20 serotinous Protea shrub species in the South African Fynbos. We analyse data on these fecundity components with neighbourhood models to infer the sign and strength of interactions throughout post-disturbance recovery, the neighbour plant traits that shape them and the spatial scale at which interac...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.cfxpnvx8p', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863628', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863629', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863630', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863631', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863632', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863633'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cfxpnvx8p', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Huw Cooksley', 'givenName': 'Huw', 'familyName': 'Cooksley', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5726-8997', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b1c9541', 'name': 'University of Hohenheim'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Hanna Walter', 'givenName': 'Hanna', 'familyName': 'Walter', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b1c9541', 'name': 'University of Hohenheim'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alexander Neu', 'givenName': 'Alexander', 'familyName': 'Neu', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04cvxnb49', 'name': 'Goethe University Frankfurt'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Henning Nottebrock', 'givenName': 'Henning', 'familyName': 'Nottebrock', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/051escj72', 'name': 'University of Montpellier'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Baptiste Schmid', 'givenName': 'Baptiste', 'familyName': 'Schmid', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03mcsbr76', 'name': 'Swiss Ornithological Institute'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Martina Treurnicht', 'givenName': 'Martina', 'familyName': 'Treurnicht', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05bk57929', 'name': 'Stellenbosch University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jörn Pagel', 'givenName': 'Jörn', 'familyName': 'Pagel', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b1c9541', 'name': 'University of Hohenheim'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matthias Schleuning', 'givenName': 'Matthias', 'familyName': 'Schleuning', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01amp2a31', 'name': 'Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Frank Schurr', 'givenName': 'Frank', 'familyName': 'Schurr', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b1c9541', 'name': 'University of Hohenheim'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.cfxpnvx8p/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Although well characterized in coastal environments, phenology remains poorly understood in the deep sea. Here we characterized intra-annual dynamics of feeding activity for the deep-sea octocoral Paragorgia arborea. Hourly changes in polyp activity were quantified using a time-lapse camera deployed for a year on Sur Ridge (1230 m depth; Northeast Pacific). The relationship between feeding and environmental variables, including surface primary production, temperature, acoustic backscatter, current speed and direction, was evaluated. Feeding activity was highly seasonal, with a dormancy period identified between January and early April, reflecting seasonal changes in food availability as suggested by primary production and acoustic backscatter data. Moreover, feeding varied with tides, wh...', 'The number of Paragorgia arborea coral colonies with open, intermediate and closed polyps was estimated from images collected every two hours by a time lapse-camera deployed between March 6, 2020, and March 16, 2021, at a depth of 1,230 m on Sur Ridge (Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary). In total, 4,439 images were annotated using the PAPARA(ZZ)I version 2.8 software application (Marcon &amp; Purser, 2017). 5 different coral colonies were monitored and classified into one of three categories: closed (retracted polyps), intermediate (polyps in intermediate state) and open (more than half of the colony with extruded polyps with fully extended tentacles).\\nEnvironmental variables (bottom pressure, bottom temperature, acoustic backscatter, current speed and direction, northward, eastward and upward flow speeds) were measured by two ADCPs (300 kHz and 1 MHz ADCPs) deployed next to the time-lapse camera between March and December 2020.

However, how signaling functions might be affected by the tendency for reduced ornament elaboration in relation to males is less well understood. We address this in mutually ornamented purple-crowned fairy-wrens. We investigated putatively ornamental (tail, ear coverts, crown) and non-ornamental (throat, back) plumage patches in females and compared our findings to previous studies in males. Both sexes have brown backs, buff-white throats, and turquoise-blue tails (bluer in males), while ear coverts are rufous in females and black in males. Both sexes also have a seasonal crown (slate-grey in females, black-and-purple in males). Dominant (breeder) females expressed more complete and greyer (more ornamented) crowns, although variation in coloration should not be discriminable by individuals. Unexpectedly, subordinates showed more colorful (saturated) rufous ear coverts, which should be discriminable. Condition de...', 'Data were collected from a population of purple-crowned fairy-wrens within the Mornington Wildlife Sactuary, a protected area located in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

In other cases, rare species may be functionally redundant with common species and do not significantly contribute to phylogenetic diversity. How rare and common species coexist and contribute to local species pools may depend upon attributes of their communities and remains an open question in ecology. Niche differentiation has served as an explanation for species coexistence, and phylogenetic relatedness provides a means to approximate how ecologically similar species are to each other. To explore the contribution of rare species to community phylogenetic diversity, we sampled twenty-one plant communities\\xa0\\xa0across the Prairie Coteau ecoregion, home of the largest tracts of untilled northern tallgrass prairie and of high conservation concern.

In cold climates, many species that are limited by snow are showing range expansions due to reduced winter severity. The European polecat (Mustela putorius) occurs over large parts of Europe with its northern range limit in southern Fennoscandia. However, it is to date unknown what factors limit polecat distribution. We thus investigated whether climate or land-use variables are more important in determining the habitat suitability for polecats in Sweden. We hypothesized that 1) climatic factors, especially the yearly number of snow days, drive habitat suitability for polecats, and that, 2) as the number of snow days is predicted to decline in the near future, habitat suitability in northern Sweden will increase. We used a combination of sightings data and a selection of national maps of environmental factors to test these hypotheses using MaxEnt models. We also used maps of ...', 'Polecat sightings data\\nTo determine the distribution and habitat suitability of polecats in Sweden, we used sightings data of polecats gathered by volunteers and documented to the Swedish Species Information Centre between 1960 and 2020 (Figure 1; Swedish Species Information Centre 2020). We validated data at the edge of the distribution by contacting the person that reported the sighting, and removed data points if there was uncertainty about the sighting, we also removed data that was categorized as roadkill. As a result, we discarded 44 of the 425 sightings before analysis. Due to an increase of popularity of the sightings platform, the majority of sightings (78%) used in the analyses was from the period 2010–2020.\\nDescription of covariates\\nWe used nine covariates distributed over four different categories to test our hypotheses (Table 1).

Yet, little is known on how downstream eDNA dispersal is affected by the combination of river discharge and source biomass effects. In this study, we aimed at unravelling the effect of source- and system-specific processes on the stream reach of eDNA. We used a longitudinal cage study in two river sections characterized by a significantly different discharge rate, where two invasive and two native fish species were introduced under two contrasting biomass treatments. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses, we found that eDNA concentrations become strongly reduced 2 km downstream from the source, an effect that is strengthened with increasing river discharge and coinciding dilution effects.

We have developed compounds that prevent farnesylation of Cryptoccoccus neoformans Ras protein by inhibiting protein farnesyltransferase with 3–4 nanomolar affinities. Farnesylation directs Ras to the cell membrane and is required for infectivity of this lethal pathogenic fungus. Our high-affinity compounds inhibit fungal growth with 3–6 micromolar minimum inhibitory concentrations, 4- to 8-fold better than Fluconazole, an antifungal commonly used in the clinic. Compounds bound with distinct inhibition mechanisms at two alternative, partially overlapping binding sites, accessed via different inhibitor conformations. We showed that antifungal potency depends critically on the selected inhibition mechanism, because this determines the efficacy of an inhibitor at low in vivo levels of enzyme and farnesyl substrate.

Many of these processes are linked to nutrient-sensing signaling pathways, suggesting that diet plays a critical role in the aging process. In fact, the protein content in the diet can affect both longevity and fecundity, but often in opposite directions. Indeed, in many solitary organisms, a protein-rich diet dramatically shortens lifespan but increases egg production. We used the ant Temnothorax rugatulus to investigate the effect of the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the diet on the survival and fecundity of fertile workers. We fed colonies either a moderately high-protein or high-carbohydrate diet (2:1 and 1:2 respectively) and monitored worker survival and egg production over nine weeks. The protein-rich diet did not alter the ability of workers to lay eggs, but reduced worker survival, suggesting ...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41zv', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859481', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859482', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859485'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv41zv', 'version': 10, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marina Choppin', 'givenName': 'Marina', 'familyName': 'Choppin', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3124-5049', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019whta54', 'name': 'University of Lausanne'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41zv/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Given the intensified effect of pathogen richness in fine roots on the strength of negative PSF through the synergistic effects of multiple pathogens, researchers have proposed a trade-off between nutrient acquisition and pathogen defence in roots. However, empirical evidence is lacking. In addition, because the interaction between pathogens and fine roots depends on the mycorrhizal types of tree species, both fine root traits and mycorrhizal types should be incorporated to reveal covariation in pathogen richness and the strength of negative PSF. In this study, we selected 50 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species and 7 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species in a subtropical forest to investigate the relationships between fine root traits and pathogen richness in fine roots and determined whether their relationships depended on plant mycorrhizal types.

Characterising genetically distinct populations and assessing connectivity across the landscape enables wildlife managers to prioritise conservation efforts with limited resources. In the NSW North Coast bioregion of Australia, one of the last remaining coastal populations of the Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) has been state-listed as an Endangered Population, owing to its geographic isolation and small census size. Using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, we examined the spatial genetic structure of Emus across south-eastern Australia and assessed the effective population size (Ne) and genetic diversity of the NSW North Coast Emu to inform management. We show significant genetic divergence between the NSW North Coast Emu and other localities based on thousands of highly resolving nuclear markers, which was not explained by geographi...', 'The data were collected as part of a population genetics study investigating gene flow and effective population sizes of Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) across south-east Australia. Feather and tissue samples were collected non-invasively and extracted DNA was sequenced via genotyping-by-sequencing methods employed by Diversity Arrays Technology, Canberra, Australia.

For each of the 106 species we calculated the rate of change in mass, head and body length, wing length, and approximated relative surface area, over time and as a function of temperature anomaly (the difference between temperatures in a given year and the interannual average). We used phylogenetic mixed models (PGLMM) to determine trends and their relation to species’ ecology.\\nResults:\\xa0Over the last seventy years there have been consistent changes through time in mass, length, and s...', 'We initially gathered measurements of nearly 11,000 birds from the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv University, collected between 1950 and 2020. These represent all birds for which either head and body length, wing length, or body mass data were present. Bird hunting is forbidden in Israel since the mid-1950s, and most specimens in the collection represent birds that were found dead, died in wildlife hospitals, or were confiscated by the authorities after being illegally hunted. Regardless of their source, birds were measured shortly after their death, and these measurements were taken by museum staff. \\xa0Because the specimens were collected and measured over several decades not all of them were measured by the same person, but new generations of museum personnel were taught by the previous ones, and used the same methods. We filtered the data to contain only adult birds, collected from the wild, in Israel. We only used species for which we had at least 30 specimens, collect...', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.j0zpc86g9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1857443', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1857444'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j0zpc86g9', 'version': 7, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shahar Dubiner', 'givenName': 'Shahar', 'familyName': 'Dubiner', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1771-0087', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04mhzgx49', 'name': 'Tel Aviv University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shai Meiri', 'givenName': 'Shai', 'familyName': 'Meiri', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04mhzgx49', 'name': 'Tel Aviv University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.j0zpc86g9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13474', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Knowledge on their distribution and population dynamics increases our understanding of processes driving disease transmission. This is the first study using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to elucidate the population genetic structure of the hermaphroditic snail Bulinus truncatus (Gastropoda, Heterobranchia) on a regional (17 to 150 km) and an inter-regional (1,000 – 5,400 km) scale. This snail species acts as an intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, which cause human and animal schistosomiasis respectively. \\nMethods: Bulinus truncatus snails were collected in Senegal, Cameroon, Egypt and France and identified through DNA barcoding. A single-end Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) library, comprising of 87 snail specimens from the respective countries, was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped against S....', 'Samples of\\xa0B. truncatus\\xa0(numbers of specimens ranging from four to 16 per locality) were collected from 2011 to 2014 in Cameroon (one site, Cam_BAK), Senegal (four sites, Sen_DIAM, Sen_GUEC, Sen_MBO, Sen_NDO), Egypt (two sites, Egy_BEK, Egy_MAN) and France (one site, Cor_SUT).\\nA single-end GBS reduced representation library (RRL) was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center). The library was prepared by digesting DNA with EcoT22I, ligating P1 and P2 Illumina sequencing primers (the former including molecular identifiers for sequence demultiplexing) and Illumina adapters, before proceeding with titration and library enrichment. The choice of the restriction enzyme followed preliminary comparisons between EcoT22I and PstI on representatives of\\xa0B. truncatus.\\nHTS data processing\\nThe\\xa0HiSeq run produced 257x106\\xa0single-end raw reads of 101 bp.

Smoke-responsive germination is a common trait in seeds in fire-prone ecosystems but has not been demonstrated in bryophyte spores. To investigate the potential role of smoke in post-fire peatland recovery, we tested the germination of spores of fifteen bryophyte species after treatment with smoke-water. Comparison of smoke responsiveness between spores of different laboratory storage times and burial depths/age (3-200 yrs old) were subsequently tested. Smoke increased germination percentage for 10 of the 15 study species, and increased germination speed for four of these. Smoke responsiveness increased along the fire frequency gradient from open expanse to forest margin, consistent with the theory that this selects for the maintenance of fire-adapted traits. Smoke enhanced germinability of 1-yr...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.n5tb2rbzz', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863832', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863833'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.n5tb2rbzz', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Climate Change', 'Fire frequency', 'germinability', 'Habitat preferences', 'Polytrichum', 'Sphagnum', 'spore age'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shuayib Yusup', 'givenName': 'Shuayib', 'familyName': 'Yusup', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9273-7282', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02rkvz144', 'name': 'Northeast Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sebastian Sundberg', 'givenName': 'Sebastian', 'familyName': 'Sundberg', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/048a87296', 'name': 'Uppsala University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mark K.

Some authors contend such divergence is concentrated along a single major axis of trait covariance, even if that axis does not lead populations directly toward fitness optimum. Other authors argue that divergence can occur readily along many phenotype axes at the same time. We use populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 14 lakes with contrasting ecological conditions to find some resolution along the continuum between these two extremes. Unlike many previous studies, we included several functional suites of traits (defensive, swimming, trophic) potentially subject to different sources of selection. We find that populations exhibit dimensionality of divergence that is high enough to preclude a history of constraint along a single axis – both for divergence in multivariate mean trai...', '', 'Please see README file'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862326', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862327', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862329', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862338', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862450', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862453', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862454'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv41xw', 'version': 6, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grant Haines', 'givenName': 'Grant', 'familyName': 'Haines', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9085-0022', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01pxwe438', 'name': 'McGill University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

While the environmental and biological ecosystem services provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that may accrue through eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration in tandem with beach nourishment in Southern Sweden. The empirical research is based on an online open-ended questionnaire in the coastal municipalities of Båstad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kri...', 'Data was collected via a qualitative semi-structured, partly open survey to the residents and beachgoers in Båstad, Ystad, Trelleborg and Kristianstad from September to November 2019. We used an online survey method for data collection to understand stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that NbS such as eelgrass restoration and beach nourishment might provide. The survey targeted with residents from the four municipalities and a total of 99 responses were collected. The online questionnaire survey was published in several Facebook groups from these municipalities. All surveys were completely anonymous and were performed at the survey portal sogosurvey.com. Questions were developed to acquire information on the behaviour, knowledge, values, perceptions and feelings of people living, working and enjoying the case study coastal areas.\\nWe used discourse analysis to categorize responses from citizens for the first three dimensions as social functions (social activities a...', 'All qualitative data files are provided in PDF and provided in both the original Swedish and translation to English.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.ksn02v77s', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858368', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858369', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858370', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858371', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858372', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858373', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858375', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858376', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858377', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858378', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858379'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ksn02v77s', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Cultural Ecosystem Services', 'Public Perceptions', 'values', 'coastal resilience', 'Climate Adaptation', 'nature-based solutions'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Lisa Van Well', 'givenName': 'Lisa', 'familyName': 'Van Well', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2066-5099', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02j2xmd27', 'name': 'Swedish Geotechnical Institute'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anelya Isayeva', 'givenName': 'Anelya', 'familyName': 'Isayeva', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79', 'name': 'Lund University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pål Axel Olsson', 'givenName': 'Pål Axel', 'familyName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79', 'name': 'Lund University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Johan Hollander', 'givenName': 'Johan', 'familyName': 'Hollander', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00v542r37', 'name': 'World Maritime University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.ksn02v77s/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor known for trans-activating liver genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and more recently implicated in energy metabolism. The gut microbiota can modulate the host xenobiotic biotransformation and contribute to the development of obesity. While the male sex confers a higher risk for NAFLD than women before menopause, the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that the presence of PXR promotes obesity by modifying the gut-liver axis in a sex-specific manner. Male and female C57BL/6 (wild-type/WT) and PXR-knockout (PXR-KO) mice were fed control or high fat diet (HFD) for 16-weeks. Serum parameters, liver histopathology, transcriptomic profiling, 16S-rDNA sequencing, and bile acid (BA) metabolomics were performed.

However, few studies have examined the influence of aging on social behavior. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are a socially monogamous and biparental rodent that live in small family groups and are now among the most popular rodent models for studies examining social behavior. Although the social behavioral trajectories of early-life development in prairie voles have been well-studied, how social behavior may change throughout adulthood remains unknown. Here we examined behavior in virgin male and female prairie voles in four different age groups: postnatal day (PND) 60–80, 140–160, 220–240, and 300–320. All animals underwent testing in a novel object task, a dominance test, a resident-intruder test, and several iterations of social approach and social interaction tests with varying types of social stimuli (i.e., novel same-sex conspecific, novel opposite-sex c...', 'Behavioral data was collected via video analysis in BORIS.', 'Excel'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3tx95x6k6', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859056', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859057', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859058', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859059', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859060', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859061', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859062'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3tx95x6k6', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['social behavior', 'aging', 'aggression', 'voles'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jeanne Powell', 'givenName': 'Jeanne', 'familyName': 'Powell', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Madison Garvin', 'givenName': 'Madison', 'familyName': 'Garvin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nicholas Lee', 'givenName': 'Nicholas', 'familyName': 'Lee', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aubrey Kelly', 'givenName': 'Aubrey', 'familyName': 'Kelly', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6013-3943', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3tx95x6k6/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Understanding why and how species populations respond differently to environmental changes is fundamental to mitigate and predict future biodiversity changes. Theoretically, species life-history strategies are key determinants shaping the response of populations to environmental impacts. Despite this, the association between species' life-histories and the response of populations to environmental changes has not been tested. In this study, we analysed the effects of recent land-cover and temperature changes on rates of population change of 1,072 populations recorded in the Living Planet Database. We selected populations with at least 5 yearly consecutive records (after imputation of missing population estimates) between 1992 and 2016, and for which we achieved high population imputation accuracy (in the cases where missing value...\", 'This dataset contains all the data used to carry out the analysis described in the original paper.', 'This dataset can be easily opened and manipulated using any kind of \"office\" or similar spreadsheet manipulation software.

To overcome this problem, we extended the widely used framework of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratios and developed the novel metric ωC, which measures the error-corrected convergence rate of protein evolution. While ωC distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes.

Egg size is a major contributor to offspring phenotype, which can influence developmental trajectories and potential resource use. However, to what extent intraspecific variation in egg size facilitates evolution of resource polymorphism is poorly understood. We studied multiple resource morphs of Icelandic Arctic charr, ranging from an anadromous morph – with a phenotype similar to the proposed ancestral phenotype – to sympatric morphs that vary in their degree of phenotypic divergence from the ancestral anadromous morph. We characterised variation in egg size and tested whether egg size influenced offspring phenotype at early-life stages (i.e. timing of- and size at- hatching and first feeding [FF]). We predicted that egg size would differ among morphs and be less variable as morphs diverge away from the ancestral anadromous phenotype. We also predicted t...', 'Female size and egg size data were measured on wild-collected females and embryos reared in temperature-controlled laboratory conditions. To characterise variation in size and developmental times, morphs were sampled at four points during development: 1) post-fertilisation (PF); eye stage (E); hatching (H); and first feeding (FF).\\xa0Mean egg size per female was estimated by measuring egg diameter of embryos at PF and E stages.\\xa0Average measurements of offspring size and DD were taken for each female at H and FF.

Zhang\\xa0&amp;\\xa0Q. Zhou\\xa0(Asteraceae, Senecioneae) from Guizhou Province, China, is described and illustrated based on its morphological characteristics and molecular evidence. It closely resembles S. confervifer and S. guangxiensis, the former in the scapigerous habit and smooth and glabrous achene surface, the latter in the calyculate involucre and purple abaxial leaf surface, and both in the shape and indumentum of leaf lamina, but differs markedly from the latter two in having fewer capitula and epappose achenes. Phylogenetic analysis based on nrITS and ndhC-trnV sequences shows that this new species belongs to the S. latouchei clade and is sister to S. guangxiensis with moderate support.', 'Morphological observation\\xa0\\nMorphological examination\\xa0and comparison\\xa0of\\xa0the new species\\xa0with S. confervifer and S. guangxiensis were based on fresh materials and herbarium\\xa0specimens.

Nonetheless, information on microbial community assembly and assembly-driving processes in organic matter-polluted urban rivers remains elusive. In this study, a field study based on water and sediment samples collected from 200 organic matter-polluted urban rivers of 82 cities in China and Indonesia is combined with laboratory water-sediment column experiments. Our findings demonstrate a unique microbiome in these urban rivers. Among the community assembly-regulating factors, both organic matter and geographic conditions play major roles in determining prokaryotic and eukaryotic community assemblies, especially regarding the critical role of organic matter in regulating taxonomic composition. Using a dissimilarity-overlap approach, we found universality ...', 'To have a comprehensive insight into microbiomes of black-odorous urban rivers, 186 mediumly and highly polluted urban rivers of 78 cities in China (June to September 2018) were selected based on the cities’ black-odorous urban river number and the water quality criteria, including DOC, redox potential and SS (NURPG, 2015; MOHURD, 2018; Liang et al., 2021) (Figure S1). In addition, water and sediment samples from 14 highly polluted urban rivers in four cities in Indonesia (May 2019) were also collected to confirm the impact of variances in geography and pollution ingredients on the urban river microbiome (Figure S1). For each sampling location, water samples (500 ml) were collected from the middle layers of urban rivers, and surface sediment samples (approximately 200 g, top layer, &lt;30 cm) were acquired using a customized sediment sampler, as previously described (Liang et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021).

In this study, we i) identified predator species from scats through an established barcoding approach, and ii) explored the use of a cheap, quick barcoding method of fox feces (n = 103). We investigated differences in diet between the red fox (predicted generalist predator) and Arctic fox (predicted specialist predator) over two years with varying prey abundance. We amplified short DNA fragments (&lt; 200 bp) from small rodents, birds and hares. For both predators, there was a high frequency of occurrence of rodents (38 - 69 %) identifying them as primary prey species and birds as secondary prey species (13-31%). This demonstrates the strength of a straightforward DNA barcoding method for dietary analyses in sympatric fox predators, with species-level resolution of prey.

However, f and g have been considered as equivalents, with e rarely considered, and their adaptation to the environment and their regulation of ecosystem productivity are unclear. Here, we analyzed the community-weighted mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of stomatal traits from tropical to cold-temperature forests. The variance of g and f was higher for arid sites, indicating greater functional niche differentiation, whereas that for e was lower, indicating convergence in efficiency. Besides, when other stomatal trait distributions remained unchanged, increasing kurtosis but decreasing skewness of g would improve ecosystem productivity, and f showed the opposite patterns. These findings highlight how the relative importance and equivalence of inter-related traits can differ at community scale.', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.w6m905qr2', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863570', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863604'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.w6m905qr2', 'version': 6, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': 'Plant science', 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Congcong Liu', 'givenName': 'Congcong', 'familyName': 'Liu', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3949-4194', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/034t30j35', 'name': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Lawren Sack', 'givenName': 'Lawren', 'familyName': 'Sack', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/046rm7j60', 'name': 'University of California Los Angeles'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nianpeng He', 'givenName': 'Nianpeng', 'familyName': 'He', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/034t30j35', 'name': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ying Li', 'givenName': 'Ying', 'familyName': 'Li', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/034t30j35', 'name': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.w6m905qr2/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2021', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

However, we know little about its effects on global patterns of daily microclimate variation, which can differentially impact species with different daily activity patterns. Using a recently developed microclimate model, we show that deforestation causes an increase in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) in lowland habitats at low latitudes and the mountains at high latitudes. Furthermore, we investigate competitive interactions between nocturnal burying beetles and all-day active blowfly maggots in forested and deforested habitats in Taiwan. We show that deforestation leads to increased DTR at higher elevations, which enhances the competitiveness of blowfly maggots during the day and leads to a higher failure rate of carcass burial by the nocturnal beetles. Thus, deforestation-induced temperature variability not only modulates exploitative competition between species with different daily activity patterns but also likely exacerbate...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.1rn8pk0xv', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870442', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870443', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870444', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870445', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870446', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870447', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870448', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1870449'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rn8pk0xv', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['deforestation', 'daily temperature fluctuation', 'daily activity pattern', 'nocturnal species', 'interspecific competition', 'Nicrophorus nepalensis'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sheng-Feng Shen', 'givenName': 'Sheng-Feng', 'familyName': 'Shen', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0631-6343', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/040bb7493', 'name': 'Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shih-Fan Chan', 'givenName': 'Shih-Fan', 'familyName': 'Chan', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/040bb7493', 'name': 'Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Dustin R.

We used next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 region to describe the complete foliar fungal microbiomes in a set of field-grown tall fescue plants over two years, and whether these fungal communities were affected by the presence of Epichloë. We used the Georgia 5 cultivar of tall fescue, grown in the field for six years prior to sampling. Plants were either uninfected with E. coenophiala, or they were infected with one of two E. coenophiala strains: the common toxic strain or the AR542 strain (sold commercially as MaxQ).

Here, we perform GWAS of 16 metabolites clustered at the intersection of amino acid catabolism, glycolysis, and ketone body metabolism in a subset of UK Biobank. We utilize the well-documented biochemistry jointly impacting these metabolites to analyze pleiotropic effects in the context of their pathways. Among the 213 lead GWAS hits, we find a strong enrichment for genes encoding pathway-relevant enzymes and transporters. We demonstrate that the effect directions of variants acting on biology between metabolite pairs often contrast with those of upstream or downstream variants as well as the polygenic background. Thus, we find that these outlier variants often reflect biology local to the traits. Finally, we explore the implications for interpreting disease GWAS, underscoring the potential of unifying biochemistry with dense metabolomics data to understa...', 'The details of the dataset processing are provided in our manuscript: https://elifesciences.org/articles/79348\\nBriefly, we performed GWAS of technically-corrected metabolite levels from the Nightingale NMR Metabolomics dataset on 94,464 European-ancestry individuals and 98,189 individuals in our ancestry-inclusive analysis using BOLT-REML and integrated these results with a curated biochemical map connecting the 16 core metabolites spanning glycolysis, ketones, and amino acids.\\nFiles with names \"*_step3.txt\" and \"*_step2.txt\" are the local genetic correlation and local heritability estimates for each approximately independent LD block (Berisa et al. 2016) using rho-HESS (Shi et al. 2017) and HESS (Shi et al. 2016), respectively.

However, a molecular dissection of their effect on females is rare. In decorated crickets, the male’s nuptial gift comprises part of the male’s spermatophore, the spermatophylax, which functions to deter the female from prematurely removing the sperm-containing portion, the ampulla, from her genital opening. However, ingested spermatophylax compounds and proteins contained in the ampulla could also influence female physiology and behavior to the male’s benefit. We investigated how mating per se and these two distinct routes of potential male-mediated manipulation influence the transcriptional response of females. We conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment on the gut and head tissue from females for whom consumption of nuptial food gifts and receipt of an ejaculate had been independently manipulated.

Overall skull size decreased, along with increasing temperatures and decreasing soil moisture, which determined the availability of the shrews’ main food source, earthworms. The magnitude of Dehnel’s phenomenon increased over time, indicating an increasing selection pressure on animals in winter. Two files include the data on 1) the size of the skulls of Sorex araneus collected in the Białowieża Forest\\xa0 between 1953 and 2004; and 2) the meteorological data from Białowieża, from 1952 to 2004.', 'Skull measurements\\nSorex araneus were collected between 1953 and 2004 in Białowieża National Park, preserved in alcohol and stored in the zoological collection of the Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, in Białowieża. The skull height, length and width (mm) of 502 S. araneus were measured using X-ray images of the alcohol-preserved specimens, as described by Lázaro et al. (2017).\\nClimate parameters in Białowieża between 1952 and 2004\\nMean temperatures (degrees Celsius), rainfall (mm), and the number of days with snow cover are routine measurements from the meteorological station in Białowieża (52.7070 N, 23.8479 E).

Biodiversity hotspots, such as the Caucasus mountains, provide unprecedented opportunities for understanding the evolutionary processes that shape species diversity and richness. Therefore, we investigated the evolution of Primula sect. Primula, a clade with a high degree of endemism in the Caucasus.\\n2. We performed phylogenetic and network analyses of whole-genome resequencing data from the entire nuclear genome, the entire chloroplast genome, and the entire heterostyly supergene. The different characteristics of the genomic partitions and the resulting phylogenetic incongruences enabled us to disentangle evolutionary histories resulting from tokogenetic versus cladogenetic processes. We provide the first phylogeny inferred from the heterostyly supergene that includes all species of Primula sect. Primula.\\n3. Our results identified recurrent admixture at deep nodes between lineages in the Caucasus as the cause of non-monophyly in Primula. Biogeographic analyses support the “out-of-th...', 'Tree files and alignments (fastas) for Primula sect. Primula phylogeny. Includes complete nuclear, plastid, and s-locus alignments.\\nAll fastas were created from VCFs that were filtered. Variant calling was performed by BCFtools v.1.8 multiallelic caller and set to output only variant site. Repetitive sequence regions were masked based on the annotation from Potente et al. (2022). Filtering was performed using VCFtools v.0.1.14 and set to remove indels and include only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in at least 80% of individuals, with a minimum site quality of 30, and a mean site depth between 5x and 60x. All fastas were output with heterozygous sites randomly resolved.\\xa0\\nFor information about phylogenies, please see the manuscript.\\xa0', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.b2rbnzsgz', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861704', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861705', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861706', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861707', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861708', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861709', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861710', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861711', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861713', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861714', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861715', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861716', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861719', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861720', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861721', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861722', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861723', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861724', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861725', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861726', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861727', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861728', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861729', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861730', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861731', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861732', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861733', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861734', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861735', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861751', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1861752'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsgz', 'version': 4, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['whole-genome resequencing', 'Primula', 'Gene flow', 'Phylogenomics'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rebecca Stubbs', 'givenName': 'Rebecca', 'familyName': 'Stubbs', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7386-2830', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02crff812', 'name': 'University of Zurich'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Elena Conti', 'givenName': 'Elena', 'familyName': 'Conti', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02crff812', 'name': 'University of Zurich'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Spyros Theodoridis', 'givenName': 'Spyros', 'familyName': 'Theodoridis', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01amp2a31', 'name': 'Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.b2rbnzsgz/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2021', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Although the assembly of microbial communities was increasingly inspected, the role of their morphological characteristics is still poorly ascertained. Here, by integrating high-throughput sequencing and robust extrapolation of traits, we investigated taxonomic and phylogenetic turnovers of various cyanobacterial morphotypes in biocrusts, as a model system, to evaluate the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes across a large geographic scale of drylands. The results showed that the non-heterocyst filamentous category dominated in arid ecosystems and the most abundant taxa had high tolerance against environmental fluctuations.

We characterized natural variation in heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression among tissues and populations of free-living Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We focused on HSPs because they prevent cellular damage and promote recovery from heat stress. We used quantitative PCR to measure gene expression of three HSPs, including those in the HSP70 and HSP90 families that have robust experimental connections to heat in past literature. First, to evaluate how tissues and, by extension, the functions that they mediate, may vary in their thermal protection, we compared HSP gene expression among neural and peripheral tissues. We hypothesized that tissues with particularly vital functions would be more protected from heat as indicated by higher HSP gene expression. We found that brain tissues had consistently higher HSP gene expression compared to the pector...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.vhhmgqnwf', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863803', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863804', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863810'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vhhmgqnwf', 'version': 4, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Thermal tolerance', 'gene expression', 'heat shock protein', 'Populations', 'brain', 'ovary', 'muscle'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mary J.

Changes to the relative species densities and composition of the wider fish community have the potential to alter the habitat-niche of sympatric Arctic charr populations. This study evaluated the temporal stability of the parasite community, diet and stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) of three sympatric Arctic charr morphs (piscivore, benthivore and planktivore) from Loch Rannoch, Scotland, in relation to changes to the fish community. All Arctic charr morphs displayed distinct differences parasite communities, diet and stable isotope signatures over time, despite the establishment of four new trophically transmitted parasite taxa, and increased fish and zooplankton consumption by the piscivorous and planktivore morphs respectively. Native parasite prevalence also increased in all Arctic charr morphs.

Leading hypotheses are forced interspecific copulations, mis-imprinting caused by mixed broods, and scarcity of conspecific mates. Using a large sample of hybrid ducks solicited from North American hunters we evaluated these hypotheses by genetically determining the mother and father species of F1 hybrids. Based on abundances in areas where their breeding ranges overlap, the frequency of hybrids varied greatly from expectations, with hybrids between species within recently derived clades being much more frequent than those between more divergent clades. Forced copulations, as measured by large phallus length asymmetries between parentals, strongly predicted the father species of most F1 hybrids. Thus, most Anas acuta x A. platyrhynchos (Northern Pintail x Mallard) F1s were sired by A. acuta, and most A. ...', 'ddRAD sequencing and Sanger sequencing of mtDNA genes.', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.34tmpg4nj', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859743', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859744', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859745', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859746', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859747'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.34tmpg4nj', 'version': 6, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['hybridization', 'ducks', 'forced copulation', 'double digest RADseq (ddRADseq)'], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Leonardo Campagna', 'givenName': 'Leonardo', 'familyName': 'Campagna', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8408-8553', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05bnh6r87', 'name': 'Cornell University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.34tmpg4nj/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274059', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

To elucidate the population genetic structure of this species, 1633 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 18 microsatellite markers (SSRs) were used to genotype samples from 27 sites representing 18 geographical populations distributed throughout the known range of the species in East Asia. Analyses of both SNPs and SSRs showed that M. onukii populations in Yunnan exhibit high genetic differentiation and structure compared to other populations. The Kagoshima (JJ) and Shizuoka (JS) populations from Japan were separated from populations from China by SNPs but clustered with Jinhua (JH), Yingde (YD), Guilin (GL), Fuzhou (FZ), Hainan (HQ), Leshan (CT), Chongqing (CY) and Zunyi (ZY) tea areas in China and the Vietnamese Vinh Phuc (VN) population based...', 'Genotype table for 18 microsatellites generated using AFLP of sequences containing repeats (FIASCO).\\xa0Each row is a microsatellite locus; each column starting with the second is an M. onukii individual.

We know, however, little about the physiology of this behaviour. Here we study how catecholaminergic hormones regulate rapid colour change in explosive breeding toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), where large groups of males gather and quickly change their colour from brown to bright yellow during reproduction. We find that both epinephrine (EP) and/or norepinephrine (NE) cause the toads’ skin to become yellow in minutes, even in the absence of social and environmental cues associated with explosive breeding. We hypothesize that natural selection drives the evolution of rapid colour change by co-opting the functional effects of catecholaminergic action. If so, then hormones involved in “fight or flight” responsivity may mechanistically facilitate the emergence of dynamic visual signals that mediate communication in a sexual context. ', 'On three separate experimental sessions, we examined the effect of EP and NE treatment on skin colouration. In each session, we randomly assigned 15 males to three different treatment groups (EP, NE, or control; n=5/group). We allowed four weeks to pass between sessions, as this time exceeds an adequate period that ensures all catecholamines have cleared from the toads’ circulation. Each experimental session consisted of two parts: (1) priming with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and (2) treatment with different catecholamines or saline solution (control). Before part 1, we measured the toads’ size (SVL, mm), weight (g) and back reflectance (baseline 1). Subsequently, we primed each toad with a single injection of 30 µl hCG (Sigma-Aldrich CG10-1VL; 20 IU/g bodyweight in saline solution) and placed them in their respective Fauna box (20x19x20 cm) for a period of five hours. hCG is a common exogenous reproductive hormone, widely used to induce reproduction and breeding behaviour in amp...', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.dbrv15f4b', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858746', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858747', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858748', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858749'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f4b', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Asian common toad', 'Duttaphrynus melanostictus', 'dynamic dichromatism', 'norepinephrine', 'vision model', 'Epinephrine'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Susanne Stückler', 'givenName': 'Susanne', 'familyName': 'Stückler', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1903-3171', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03prydq77', 'name': 'University of Vienna'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matthew Fuxjager', 'givenName': 'Matthew', 'familyName': 'Fuxjager', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05gq02987', 'name': 'Brown University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Doris Preininger', 'givenName': 'Doris', 'familyName': 'Preininger', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03prydq77', 'name': 'University of Vienna'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.dbrv15f4b/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Most theories on sex ratio manipulation focus on maternal strategies and sex-biased maternal allocation. Recent studies report paternal influences on both offspring sex ratio and post-partum sex-biased maternal allocation. We used long-term data on marked kangaroos to investigate if and how paternal mass and skeletal size, both determinants of male reproductive success, influenced (a) offspring sex in interaction with maternal mass, and (b) post-partum sex-biased maternal allocation. When mothers were light, the probability of having a son increased with paternal mass. Heavy mothers showed the opposite trend. A similar result emerged when considering paternal size instead of mass. Post-partum maternal sex-specific allocation was independent of paternal mass or size.

Resultant divergence in mating traits within a species may generate downstream reproductive isolation between populations with\\xa0displaced and non-displaced traits, referred to as the cascade reinforcement hypothesis. We examined this hypothesis using three allopatric populations of the ground beetle\\xa0Carabus maiyasanus\\xa0with\\xa0a genital lock-and-key system. This species shows RCD in male and female genital morphologies in populations in contact with the sister species\\xa0C. iwawakianus. In a reciprocal mating experiment using three allopatric populations with differences in male and female genital sizes, inseminationfailure increased as the difference in genital size increased. Based on the reproductive isolation index, insemination failure was the major postmating-prezygotic isolation barrier,...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.8931zcrv0', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860894', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860895', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860896', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860897', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860898'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8931zcrv0', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Yasuoki Takami', 'givenName': 'Yasuoki', 'familyName': 'Takami', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6507-2115', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03tgsfw79', 'name': 'Kobe University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.8931zcrv0/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Analysing how and why lianas are distributed in forest canopies at landscape scales will help us determine the mechanisms driving changes in lianas over time. This will improve our understanding of liana ecology and projections of tropical forest carbon storage now and into the future. Despite competing hypotheses on the mechanisms driving spatial patterning of lianas, few studies have integrated multiple tree-level biotic and abiotic factors in an analytical framework. None have done so in the Palaeotropics, which are biogeographically and evolutionarily distinct from the Neotropics, where most research on lianas has been conducted.\\nWe used an unoccupied aerial system (UAS; drone) to assess liana load in 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia.

To investigate the microbial communities on the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces, swabs were collected from both surfaces of two garden plants, Rhapis excelsa and Cordyline fruticosa.\\nResults\\nThe abaxial surface of Rhapis excelsa and Cordyline fruticosa had fewer bacteria in contrast to their adaxial counterpart. This observation was consistent between noon and midnight and across five different locations. Co-occurrence network analysis further showed that bacteria are found almost exclusively on the adaxial surface while only a small group of leaf blotch fungi survive on the abaxial surface. There are higher densities of stomata on the abaxial surface and these openings are vulnerable ports of entry into the plant host. While one might argue about the settling of dust particles and microorganisms on the adaxial surface, we detected differences in reactive chemic...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.dncjsxkvn', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858399', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858400', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858424'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dncjsxkvn', 'version': 9, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kenny Jia Xu Lau', 'givenName': 'Kenny Jia Xu', 'familyName': 'Lau', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3666-5253', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02e7b5302', 'name': 'Nanyang Technological University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Elena S.

Previous studies showed that bark cover at early-decay stage had profound control on the invertebrate assemblages of bark and wood, with possible consequence for the decomposition process. However, previous experimental designs could not disentangle how bark versus wood traits affect the invertebrate assemblage process in bark and/or wood separately because wood traits of different tree species may vary independently from bark traits. Furthermore, we do not know whether such tree species specific bark trait effects are still influential at mid-decay stage.\\n2. To unravel whether and how bark and wood traits influence invertebrate communities in tree logs at mid-decay stage, we introduce reciprocal bark transplantation within pairs of different tree species as a new method. We applied this method to two pairs of phylogenetically contrasting species of gymnosperms (pair I: Araucaria araucana and Cryptomeria japonica, pair II: Picea abies and Thuja plicata) and another gymnosperm (Chamae...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.7h44j0zxw', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863189', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863190', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863191'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7h44j0zxw', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Ecosystem function and services', 'design limitation', 'Gymnosperms', 'methodology', 'mid-decay stage', 'tree species specific', 'xylem'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Chenhui Chang', 'givenName': 'Chenhui', 'familyName': 'Chang', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4107-2065', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02v51f717', 'name': 'Peking University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matty Berg', 'givenName': 'Matty', 'familyName': 'Berg', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Richard van Logtestijn', 'givenName': 'Richard', 'familyName': 'van Logtestijn', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Juan Zuo', 'givenName': 'Juan', 'familyName': 'Zuo', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/034t30j35', 'name': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Li Lin', 'givenName': 'Li', 'familyName': 'Lin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04kx2sy84', 'name': 'Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Cynthia Bom', 'givenName': 'Cynthia', 'familyName': 'Bom', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jesper Wolters', 'givenName': 'Jesper', 'familyName': 'Wolters', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Maarten Biesbroeck', 'givenName': 'Maarten', 'familyName': 'Biesbroeck', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pepijn de Ruijter', 'givenName': 'Pepijn', 'familyName': 'de Ruijter', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mariet Hefting', 'givenName': 'Mariet', 'familyName': 'Hefting', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04pp8hn57', 'name': 'Utrecht University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ute Sass-Klaassen', 'givenName': 'Ute', 'familyName': 'Sass-Klaassen', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Wageningen University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Hans Cornelissen', 'givenName': 'Hans', 'familyName': 'Cornelissen', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.7h44j0zxw/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Informed conservation and management of wildlife require sufficient monitoring to understand population dynamics and to direct conservation actions. Because resources available for monitoring are limited, conservation practitioners must strive to make monitoring as cost-effective as possible.\\n2. Our focus was on assessing the value of monitoring to the adaptive harvest management (AHM) program for pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the costs and benefits of a capture-mark-resight (CMR) program, a productivity survey, and biannual population censuses. Using all available data, we fit an integrated population model (IPM) and assumed that inference derived from it represented the benchmark against which reduced monitoring was to be judged. We then fit IPMs to reduced sets of monitoring data and compared their estimates of demographic parameters and expected management performance against the benchmark IPM.\\n3. Costs and the precision...', 'Population counts conducted in spring and autumn – Internationally coordinated population counts of pink-footed geese have been performed annually since 1990 in Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands in late October or early November (hereafter referred to as the November count) (Madsen et al., 1999). Over time, the population has expanded its distribution and the spatial coverage of the count has repeatedly been extended to capture new sites occupied by geese (Madsen, Christensen, Balsby, &amp; Tombre, 2015). Since 2005, the population has also been counted in Norway, and since 2016 in Sweden. Because of increasing challenges in monitoring the autumn population, an additional count was introduced in May in 2010, which includes Norway, Denmark, Sweden and, since 2016, Finland. The known sites are covered by a network of trained observers who coordinate the coverage. The May census costs €5,327 per year for academic staff salary and travel costs of volunteers.

While strong social ties have been linked to cooperation in several social mammals, it is unclear the extent to which weak social ties can support cooperation, particularly among non-kin. We tested the hypothesis that weakly affiliative social relationships support cooperative coalition formation using 10 years of behavioural data on wild female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees typically disperse and reside with non-kin as adults. Their social relationships are differentiated but often relatively weak, with few dyads sharing strong bonds. Females occasionally form aggressive coalitions together. Three measures of relationship quality - party association, five-meter proximity, and whether a dyad groomed - positively predicted coalitions, indicating that relationship quality influenced coalition partnerships. However, dyads that gro...', 'This data is comprised of behavioral data on adult female chimpanzees living in Kibale National Park from 2010-2019. For analysis 1 (long term correlational analysis), behavioural observations are summarized into dyadic rates and counts of behaviors per two year time periods. This includes the number of times the dyad was in the same party, the number of coalitions the dyad engaged in together, a five-meter association index, a grooming duration index, whethere or not the dyad ever groomed dudring the period (0/1) the combined rank of the dyad, whether the dyad involved any immigrant females, whether the dyad consisted of females related to each other, and the total time the dyad was in the same party when one of females was the focal. For analysis 2 (partner selection analysis), data is organized per dyad at each coalition event.

Consequently, plant species have acquired traits that allow them to resist and regenerate in an environment with recurrent fires. A key trait in fire-prone ecosystems is the age at first reproduction (maturity age); populations of non-resprouting species cannot persist when fire interval is shorter than this age. Maturity age is variable among individuals, so we hypothesize that short fire intervals select for early seed production (precocity). We selected 13 plots with different fire regimes in eastern Spain, all dominated by Pinus halepensis (a non-resprouting serotinous species). Then, we evaluated the age at first reproduction and the size of the canopy seed bank of each individual pine. Our results show a significant effect of fire regime on the onset of reproduction in this species, suggesting a selection towards higher precocity in populations subject to shorter fire intervals. Due to this higher precocity, pines stored more...', 'We selected 13 sites dominated by Pinus halepensis trees in the Valencia region (eastern Spain) across a range of altitudes and climatic conditions. In each site, we established 4 transects, spaced by at least 100 m. In each transect, we haphazardly selected and georeferenced 10 trees, separated by at least 10 m. For each tree, we measured its basal diameter (10 cm above ground) and the distance to the two closest trees. Then, we compute the annual growth rate as the basal diameter (cm) divided by the age (years) and the average of the distances to the 2 closest trees. Afterward, we estimated the age of each tree by counting whorls. For reproductive trees, we also estimated the age of each cone following the same method of counting whorls (avoiding immature cone cohorts; i.e., the last or last two cohorts depending on the sampling season) and recorded whether they were open (non-serotinous), closed (serotinous cones), or from the last cohort considered (closed but serotiny unknown).

Given the enormous amount of genetic information, scientists are able to perform mammoth tasks to improve the standard of health care such as determining genetic influences on outcome of allogeneic transplantation. Cloud-based computing has increasingly become a key choice for many scientists, engineers and institutions as it offers on-demand network access and users can conveniently rent rather than buy all required computing resources. With the positive advancements of cloud computing and nanopore sequencing data output, we were motivated to develop an automated and scalable analysis pipeline utilizing cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to accelerate HLA genotyping service and improve the efficiency of the workflow at lower cost. In this study, we describe (i) the selection process for suitable virtual machine sizes for computing resources to balance between the ...', 'Manual analysis performed onsite versus Automated analysis

We quantified wolverine (Gulo gulo) population trends from 2011 to 2020 in &gt;14 000 km2 protected and non-protected habitat in southwestern Canada. We conducted wolverine and multi-species surveys using non-invasive DNA and remote camera-based methods. We developed Bayesian integrated models combining spatial capture-recapture data of marked and unmarked individuals with occupancy data. Wolverine density and occupancy declined by 39 percent, with an annual population growth rate of 0.925. Density within protected areas was 3 times higher than outside and declined between 2011 (3.6 wolverines/1000 km2) and 2020 (2.1 wolverines/1000 km2).

The purpose of this study was to use reanalysis and satellite data similar to those used in global and regional dust emission models to calculate the probability that a high wind event happens during the period that antecedent precipitation would have left the active layer wet. The results indicate that the answer to this question is more strongly related to regional climate than soil texture. For more than half of the globe with mean annual precipitation &lt; 500 mm/year, the probability of precipitation influencing dust emission is greater than 30 – 40%. Thus, rain-derived soil moisture in the active layer should not be ignored in models throughout much of the world’s dust-producing regions.', 'A global map of sand, silt, and clay fractions was derived from the global WISE v. 3.1 30 x 30 arcsec database which is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database [Batjes, 2016]. For each cell of this dataset, there are up to nine different soil components. For each cell, percent sand, silt and clay were derived by calculating the average of all available components, weighted by their fractional area in the cell. These average fractions were resampled to 0.25° x 0.25°, the same resolution as the precipitation data, and drying time was calculated using Equation 1.\\xa0\\nRavi et al. [2006] conducted experiments on six soils that provide estimates of the time it takes the active layer to dry (i.e., for a wet surface to return come into equilibrium with ambient relative humidity). A parameterization for these drying times (DTs) for soils based on soil texture data created by regressing DT against fractions of sand, silt, and clay:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DT (minutes) = 15.95 % Sand + 28.05 % Silt + 20....', 'Data are in TIFF/GeoTIFF Format and can be opened in standard image processing (for remote sensing data) or GIS (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) software.

This subspecies, an unusual morph lacking the typical lateral bony plates of the G. aculeatus complex, occurs at arid southern latitudes in the eastern Pacific Ocean and survives in only three inland locations. Managers have been stymied by a lack of molecular data to prioritize conservation efforts, including basic questions about the ancestry and genetic distinctiveness of unarmored populations. We sampled G. aculeatus from 36 localities and used microsatellites and whole genome data to place unarmored populations within the broader evolutionary context of G. aculeatus across southern California/northern Baja California. We identified three genetic groups, with none consisting solely of unarmored populations.

However, a mismatch may lead to different capacities for providing climatic refuge to dispersing species. We compiled community data on zooplankton, ectothermic animals that form the consumer basis of most aquatic food webs, from over 1,200 mountain lakes and ponds across western North America to assess biodiversity along geographic temperature gradients spanning nearly 3,750 metres of elevation and 30 degrees latitude. Species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and functional diversity all showed contrasting responses across gradients, with richness metrics plateauing at low elevations but exhibiting intermediate latitudinal maxima. The nonmonotonic/hump-shaped diversity trends with latitude emerged from geographic interactions, including weaker latitudinal relationships at higher elevations...', 'Records of zooplankton occurrence over a 52-year period (1964 to 2015) were compiled from multiple sources, including published articles, technical reports, and government datasets (previously described by Loewen et al., 2019).\\nData were standardized to reflect current taxonomy as per Appendix S1 of Loewen et al., (2019), and 119 taxa (identified to genus to higher) were retained analysis.\\nREFERENCES\\nLoewen, C.J.G., Strecker, A.L., Larson, G.L., Vogel, A., Fischer, J.M., &amp; Vinebrooke, R.D.

Climate warming may affect multiple aspects of plant life history, including important factors such as germination responses and the key trade-off between offspring size and number. As a case study to address these concepts, we used an alpine plant (waxy bluebell, Wahlenbergia ceracea; Campanulaceae) that shows plasticity to warming in seed traits and in which seed dormancy status regulates germination. We chose an alpine species because alpine environments are ecosystems particularly under threat by climate change.\\n2. We conducted germination assays under cool and warm temperatures using seeds produced by individuals that were grown under historical (cooler) and future (warmer) temperature scenarios. We assessed the presence of a seed size vs number trade-off, and then examined the effects of seed number and size on germination percentage, the fractions of dormant and viable seeds, and germination velocity. Further, we examined whether warming during parental growth and during germi...', \"Experiments were conducted using the plant species Wahlnebrgia ceracea (waxy bluebells). Two datasets were used in this manuscript.\\n1) Seed size vs number trade-off: Parental individuals from a total of 30 lines ('Line') were grown in growth chambers for 191 days under temperature conditions of a historical/cooler (1960–1970) or a projected future/warmer (2090–2100) climate ('Parental_Temperature'). The parental individuals were randomly assigned to one of three blocks, which corresponded to positions inside the chambers, and each block was equivalent in all chambers ('Block'). Day and night temperatures during the experiment were changed every 15 days to mimic seasonality, with the maximum day temperatures during the peak of summer being 24°C and 29°C for the historical and future parental temperatures, respectively. After 100 days since the imposition of the temperature treatments (during the peak of the summer), half of the plants were moved for 5 days to new chambers, where the temp...\", 'Files can be opened using Excel and analysed using R.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.np5hqbzx9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860504', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860505', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860506'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.np5hqbzx9', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['warming', 'parental effects', 'germination responses', 'seed dormancy', 'size vs number trade-off', 'Fitness', 'phenotypic plasticity', 'Alpine environments'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rocco Notarnicola', 'givenName': 'Rocco', 'familyName': 'Notarnicola', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9860-6497', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Adrienne Nicotra', 'givenName': 'Adrienne', 'familyName': 'Nicotra', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Loeske Kruuk', 'givenName': 'Loeske', 'familyName': 'Kruuk', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01nrxwf90', 'name': 'University of Edinburgh'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pieter Arnold', 'givenName': 'Pieter', 'familyName': 'Arnold', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.np5hqbzx9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Such evolutionary impacts could be caused by N altering patterns of natural selection (i.e., trait-fitness relationships) and the opportunity for selection (i.e., variance in relative fitness). Because at the community level N addition favors species with light acquisition strategies (e.g., tall species), we predict that N would also increase selection favoring those same traits. We also hypothesize that N could alter the opportunity for selection via its effects on mean fitness and/or competitive asymmetries.To investigate these evolutionary consequences of N, we quantified the strength of selection and the opportunity for selection in replicated populations of the annual grass Setaria faberi Herrm.

Thanks to advances in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, a number of efficient ramp merging strategies have been developed. However, most of the existing CAV-based ramp merging strategies assume that all the vehicles are CAVs or do not differentiate vehicle type (i.e., passenger cars vs. heavy-duty trucks). In this study, we propose a decentralized cooperative ramp merging application for connected vehicles (both connected trucks and connected cars) in a mixed-traffic environment. In addition, we develop a multi-human-in-the-loop (MHuiL) simulation platform that integrates SUMO traffic simulator with two game engine-based driving simulators, allowing us to investigate the interactions between two human drivers under various traffic scenarios. The case study shows that the decentralized cooperative ramp merging application, which provides speed guidance to the con...', 'The dataset was collected from the custom-built multi-human-in-the-loop simulation platform by the research team.

It is especially important to evaluate the thermal ecology of endangered ectotherm species now so that mitigation measures can be taken as early as possible. A recent study of the thermal ecology of the federally endangered Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard (Gambelia sila) suggested that they face major activity restrictions due to thermal constraints in their desert habitat, but that large shade-providing shrubs act as thermal buffers to allow them to maintain surface activity without overheating. We replicated this study and also included a population of G. sila with no access to large shrubs to facilitate comparison of the thermal ecology of G. sila in shrubless and shrubbed populations. We found that G. sila without access to shrubs spent more time sheltering inside rode...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3xsj3txh9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077865', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077867', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077868', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077869', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077870', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077872'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3xsj3txh9', 'version': 5, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nicole Gaudenti', 'givenName': 'Nicole', 'familyName': 'Gaudenti', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6765-5533', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05by5hm18', 'name': 'California State Polytechnic University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3xsj3txh9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2021', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

Here, we present devCellPy a highly accurate and precise machine learning-enabled tool that enables automated prediction of cell types across complex annotation hierarchies. To demonstrate the power of devCellPy, we construct a murine cardiac developmental atlas from published datasets encompassing 104,199 cells from E6.5-E16.5 and train devCellPy to generate a cardiac prediction algorithm. Using this algorithm, we observe a high prediction accuracy (>90%) across multiple layers of annotation and across de novo murine developmental data. Furthermore, we conduct a cross-species prediction of cardiomyocyte subtypes from in vitro-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells and unexpectedly uncover a predominance of left ventricular (LV) identity that we confirmed by an LV-specific TBX5 lineage tracing system. Together, our results show devCellPy to be a useful tool for automated cell prediction across complex cellular hierarchies, species, and experimental systems. A major informatic challenge in single cell RNA-sequencing analysis is the precise annotation of datasets where cells exhibit complex multilayered identities or transitory states. Here the authors present devCellPy, a Python-based package that enables the automated prediction of cell types across complex cellular hierarchies, species, and experimental systems with high accuracy, particularly for developmental scRNA-seq datasets.', 'datePublished': '2022-09-07', 'dateModified': '2022-09-07', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '20', 'license':

The results of our temporal window construction for water availability variables (precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and the Palmer drought severity index [PDSI]) identified spatial patterns across the study area that aligned with regional climate patterns, particularly with regards to drought-prone counties of eastern Washington. Using these optimum time-lagged correlational relationships between insurance loss and individual climate variables, along with commodity pricing, we constructed a regression-based random forest model for insurance loss prediction and evaluation of climatic feature importance.

We compared high dimensional immunophenotypes of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets of participants in a phase 2 randomized, controlled, peanut OIT trial who achieved SU vs. DS (no vs. with allergic reactions upon food challenge after a withdrawal period; n=21 vs. 30 respectively among total 120 intent-to-treat participants). Lower frequencies of naïve CD8+ T cells and terminally differentiated CD57+ CD8+ T cell subsets at baseline (pre-OIT) were highly associated with SU. Frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells showed a significant positive correlation with peanut- and Ara h 2-specific IgE at baseline.\\xa0 Higher frequencies of IL-4+ and IFNg+ CD8+ T cells post-OIT were negatively correlated with SU.

Clarifying the role of construction behavior on a macroevolutionary scale is crucial to interpreting phenotypic evolution. Spiders, an extremely successful group of animals exhibiting a wide variety of functional, morphological, and behavioral diversity, are ideal candidates to test whether animal behaviors are related to their phenotypic evolution. Herein, we reconstructed the phylogenomic relationships of 303 spiders covering 105 families with 99 newly developed molecular markers that universally apply across Araneae, and explicitly tested the potential link between construction behavior and somatic evolution based on extensive morphological data from 3,342 extant species and 682 fossil species. Our dated molecular phylogeny provides the backbone for analyses, revealing the behavioral and ecological processes behind these spiders’ morphological adaptations.

The purpose of this study was to use reanalysis and satellite data similar to those used in global and regional dust emission models to calculate the probability that a high wind event happens during the period that antecedent precipitation would have left the active layer wet. The results indicate that the answer to this question is more strongly related to regional climate than soil texture. For more than half of the globe with mean annual precipitation &lt; 500 mm/year, the probability of precipitation influencing dust emission is greater than 30 – 40%. Thus, rain-derived soil moisture in the active layer should not be ignored in models throughout much of the world’s dust producing regions.', 'A global map of sand, silt, and clay fractions was derived from the global WISE v. 3.1 30 x 30 arcsec database which is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database (Batjes, 2016). For each cell of this dataset, there are up to nine different soil components. For each cell, percent sand, silt and clay were derived by calculating the average of all available components, weighted by their fractional area in the cell. These average fractions were resampled to 0.25° x 0.25°, the same resolution as the precipitation data, and drying time was calculated using Equation 1.\\xa0\\nRavi\\xa0et al. (2006) conducted experiments on six soils that provide estimates of the time it takes the active layer to dry (i.e., for a wet surface to return come into equilibrium with ambient relative humidity). A parameterization for these drying times (DTs) for soils based on soil texture data created by regressing DT against fractions of sand, silt, and clay:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DT (minutes) = 15.95 % Sand + 28.05 % Silt + 20....', 'Data are in TIFF/GeoTIFF Format and can be opened in standard image processing (for remote sensing data) or GIS (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) software.

These differences are likely to impact the balance between costs and benefits to individuals seeking reproduction, thus entailing evolutionary repercussions. Here, we look into an unusual population (Baltic Sea) of the broadnosed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle, where males do not seem to select females based on size and hypothesise that this pattern may derive from a reduction of direct benefits to the male. We further hypothesise that if larger females do not persistently secure a higher reproductive success, either through pre- or post-copulatory sexual selection, a decrease in sexual size dimorphism in the Baltic population should be apparent, especially when contrasted with a well-studied population, inhabiting similar latitudes (Swedish west coast), where males prefer larger females.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found that, in the Baltic popula...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.0cfxpnvx7', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1096706', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1096707'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0cfxpnvx7', 'version': 4, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Syngnathus typhle', 'Baltic Sea'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nuno Monteiro', 'givenName': 'Nuno', 'familyName': 'Monteiro', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6994-4673', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CIBIO/InBIO, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mário Cunha', 'givenName': 'Mário', 'familyName': 'Cunha', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CIBIO/InBIO, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nídia Macedo', 'givenName': 'Nídia', 'familyName': 'Macedo', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'CIBIO/InBIO, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jonathan Wilson', 'givenName': 'Jonathan', 'familyName': 'Wilson', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04ehtgm24', 'name': 'Lusíada University of Porto'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Gunilla Rosenqvist', 'givenName': 'Gunilla', 'familyName': 'Rosenqvist', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/0554h7e84', 'name': 'Department of Earth Sciences'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anders Berglund', 'givenName': 'Anders', 'familyName': 'Berglund', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Department of Ecology and Genetics/Animal Ecology, Uppsala University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.0cfxpnvx7/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2019', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5760', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

A highly kinked DNA structure in complex with human PARP-1 domains led to the proposal that SSB sensing in Eukaryotes relies on dynamics of both the broken DNA double helix and PARP-1’s multi-domain organization. Here, we directly probe this fundamental yet poorly understood process at the single-molecule level. Quantitative smFRET and structural ensemble calculations reveal how PARP-1’s N-terminal zinc fingers convert DNA SSBs from a largely unperturbed conformation, via an intermediate state into the highly kinked DNA conformation. Our data suggest an induced fit mechanism via a multi-domain assembly cascade that drives SSB sensing and stimulates an interplay with the scaffold protein XRCC1 orchestrating subsequent DNA repair events. Interestingly, a clinically used PARP-1 inhibitor Niraparib shifts the equilibrium towards the unkinked DNA conformation, whereas the inhibitor EB47 stabilizes ...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.66t1g1k3v', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859600', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859601', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859652'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k3v', 'version': 7, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jens Michaelis', 'givenName': 'Jens', 'familyName': 'Michaelis', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2739-4172', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anna Sefer', 'givenName': 'Anna', 'familyName': 'Sefer', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Eleni Kallis', 'givenName': 'Eleni', 'familyName': 'Kallis', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tobias Eilert', 'givenName': 'Tobias', 'familyName': 'Eilert', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00q32j219', 'name': 'Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany)'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Carlheinz Röcker', 'givenName': 'Carlheinz', 'familyName': 'Röcker', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Olga Kolesnikova', 'givenName': 'Olga', 'familyName': 'Kolesnikova', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03mstc592', 'name': 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'David Neuhaus', 'givenName': 'David', 'familyName': 'Neuhaus', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00tw3jy02', 'name': 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sebastian Eustermann', 'givenName': 'Sebastian', 'familyName': 'Eustermann', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03mstc592', 'name': 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.66t1g1k3v/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n",

However, techniques and strategies have changed over the years. We looked at procedural characteristics and outcome in an all-comer, non-selected cohort of patients at our center.\\n738 out of 1977 patients were retrospectively analyzed receiving MVR with and without concomitant procedures at one center. The cohort was divided into three periods: P1: 2004-2009 (134 patienst); P2: 2010-204 (294 patients); and P3 : 2015-1019 (310 patients). Clinical data from our own database were compiled. Demographic data, procedural characteristics, outcome data were compiled and case-wise organized (first row: Item-descriptions for respective columns).Statistics were performed: numerical data: Student's-t, Mann-Withney-U, Categorical data: Fisher, X², Cochrane Armitage, Risk-factor analyis, Kendall's Tau, Kaplan-Meie...\", \"15 years retrospective study, single center, clinical data, assessment of late survival, descriptive statistics, numerical data: Student's-t, Mann-Withney-U, Categorical data: Fisher, X2,\\xa0 Cochrane-Armitage, Risk-factor analysis, Kendall's Tau, Kaplan-Meier-Survival\\nData are casewise (rows) organized.

A method was built to simultaneously determine ten common commercial organophosphate ester flame retardants in oysters. After the careful optimization of conditions, the organophosphate esters (OPEs) in oyster sample were extracted with hexane assisted by ultrasound, purified with NH2 solid-phase extraction column, eluted with the mixture solution of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v), and finally detected by gas chromatography coupled with tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS). All the ten compounds in the concentrations ranging from 0.5 ng·mL-1 to 100 ng·mL-1 showed good linearity with their R2 higher than 0.9991. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for the organophosphate esters were from 0.03 ng·g-1 to 0.47 ng·g-1 (dry weight) and from 0.1 ng·g-1 to 1.56 ng·g-1 (dry weight), respectively. At the three spiking levels with five replicates, recoveries of organophosp...', '0.5 g of oyster sample was weighed into a 50 mL centrifuge tube and then equilibrated for 30\\u202fmin followed by the addition of 50 μL mixture of internal standards (1 μg·mL-1).\\nAfter the addition of 3 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate and 10 mL of hexane, the mixture in the centrifuge tube was vortexed for 2 min (IKA MS3 Basic, IKA Works GmbH &amp; Co, Germany), ultrasonically treated for 30 min (KQ-250E, Kun Shan Ultrasonic Instruments Co., Ltd, China), and then centrifuged for 10 min at 5500 rpm at 4℃ (Anke DL-6000B, Shanghai Anting Scientific Instruments Factory, China). The supernatant was transferred to another 50 mL tube. The extraction process was repeated and the supernatant of the two extractions was then applied to the NH2 cartridge which has been preconditioned with 3 mL of DCM/EA (1:1, v/v) and 3 mL of hexane. After rinsing with 3 mL of hexane, the target compounds were eluted with 6 mL of DCM/EA (1:1, v/v).
