Given the intensified effect of pathogen richness in fine roots on the strength of negative PSF through the synergistic effects of multiple pathogens, researchers have proposed a trade-off between nutrient acquisition and pathogen defence in roots. However, empirical evidence is lacking. In addition, because the interaction between pathogens and fine roots depends on the mycorrhizal types of tree species, both fine root traits and mycorrhizal types should be incorporated to reveal covariation in pathogen richness and the strength of negative PSF. In this study, we selected 50 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species and 7 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species in a subtropical forest to investigate the relationships between fine root traits and pathogen richness in fine roots and determined whether their relationships depended on plant mycorrhizal types.

It is especially important to evaluate the thermal ecology of endangered ectotherm species now so that mitigation measures can be taken as early as possible. A recent study of the thermal ecology of the federally endangered Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard (Gambelia sila) suggested that they face major activity restrictions due to thermal constraints in their desert habitat, but that large shade-providing shrubs act as thermal buffers to allow them to maintain surface activity without overheating. We replicated this study and also included a population of G. sila with no access to large shrubs to facilitate comparison of the thermal ecology of G. sila in shrubless and shrubbed populations. We found that G. sila without access to shrubs spent more time sheltering inside rode...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3xsj3txh9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077865', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077867', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077868', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077869', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077870', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1077872'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3xsj3txh9', 'version': 5, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nicole Gaudenti', 'givenName': 'Nicole', 'familyName': 'Gaudenti', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6765-5533', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05by5hm18', 'name': 'California State Polytechnic University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3xsj3txh9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2021', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

This subspecies, an unusual morph lacking the typical lateral bony plates of the G. aculeatus complex, occurs at arid southern latitudes in the eastern Pacific Ocean and survives in only three inland locations. Managers have been stymied by a lack of molecular data to prioritize conservation efforts, including basic questions about the ancestry and genetic distinctiveness of unarmored populations. We sampled G. aculeatus from 36 localities and used microsatellites and whole genome data to place unarmored populations within the broader evolutionary context of G. aculeatus across southern California/northern Baja California. We identified three genetic groups, with none consisting solely of unarmored populations.

However, how changes in plant composition and species richness mediate SOC responses to climate warming and land-use change remains poorly understood. Using data from a 7-year warming and clipping field experiment in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we examined the direct effects of warming and clipping on SOC storage versus their indirect effects mediated by plant functional type and species richness. We found that warming significantly increased SOC storage by 8.1% and clipping decreased it by 6.4%, which was closely correlated with the corresponding response of below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP). We also found a negative correlation between SOC storage and species richness, which was ascribed to the increased BNPP via enhancing the dominance of grasses and decreasing species richness under warming.

A highly kinked DNA structure in complex with human PARP-1 domains led to the proposal that SSB sensing in Eukaryotes relies on dynamics of both the broken DNA double helix and PARP-1’s multi-domain organization. Here, we directly probe this fundamental yet poorly understood process at the single-molecule level. Quantitative smFRET and structural ensemble calculations reveal how PARP-1’s N-terminal zinc fingers convert DNA SSBs from a largely unperturbed conformation, via an intermediate state into the highly kinked DNA conformation. Our data suggest an induced fit mechanism via a multi-domain assembly cascade that drives SSB sensing and stimulates an interplay with the scaffold protein XRCC1 orchestrating subsequent DNA repair events. Interestingly, a clinically used PARP-1 inhibitor Niraparib shifts the equilibrium towards the unkinked DNA conformation, whereas the inhibitor EB47 stabilizes ...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.66t1g1k3v', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859600', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859601', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859652'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k3v', 'version': 7, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jens Michaelis', 'givenName': 'Jens', 'familyName': 'Michaelis', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2739-4172', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anna Sefer', 'givenName': 'Anna', 'familyName': 'Sefer', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Eleni Kallis', 'givenName': 'Eleni', 'familyName': 'Kallis', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tobias Eilert', 'givenName': 'Tobias', 'familyName': 'Eilert', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00q32j219', 'name': 'Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany)'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Carlheinz Röcker', 'givenName': 'Carlheinz', 'familyName': 'Röcker', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/032000t02', 'name': 'University of Ulm'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Olga Kolesnikova', 'givenName': 'Olga', 'familyName': 'Kolesnikova', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03mstc592', 'name': 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'David Neuhaus', 'givenName': 'David', 'familyName': 'Neuhaus', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00tw3jy02', 'name': 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sebastian Eustermann', 'givenName': 'Sebastian', 'familyName': 'Eustermann', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03mstc592', 'name': 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.66t1g1k3v/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Climate warming may affect multiple aspects of plant life history, including important factors such as germination responses and the key trade-off between offspring size and number. As a case study to address these concepts, we used an alpine plant (waxy bluebell, Wahlenbergia ceracea; Campanulaceae) that shows plasticity to warming in seed traits and in which seed dormancy status regulates germination. We chose an alpine species because alpine environments are ecosystems particularly under threat by climate change.\\n2. We conducted germination assays under cool and warm temperatures using seeds produced by individuals that were grown under historical (cooler) and future (warmer) temperature scenarios. We assessed the presence of a seed size vs number trade-off, and then examined the effects of seed number and size on germination percentage, the fractions of dormant and viable seeds, and germination velocity. Further, we examined whether warming during parental growth and during germi...', \"Experiments were conducted using the plant species Wahlnebrgia ceracea (waxy bluebells). Two datasets were used in this manuscript.\\n1) Seed size vs number trade-off: Parental individuals from a total of 30 lines ('Line') were grown in growth chambers for 191 days under temperature conditions of a historical/cooler (1960–1970) or a projected future/warmer (2090–2100) climate ('Parental_Temperature'). The parental individuals were randomly assigned to one of three blocks, which corresponded to positions inside the chambers, and each block was equivalent in all chambers ('Block'). Day and night temperatures during the experiment were changed every 15 days to mimic seasonality, with the maximum day temperatures during the peak of summer being 24°C and 29°C for the historical and future parental temperatures, respectively. After 100 days since the imposition of the temperature treatments (during the peak of the summer), half of the plants were moved for 5 days to new chambers, where the temp...\", 'Files can be opened using Excel and analysed using R.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.np5hqbzx9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860504', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860505', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1860506'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.np5hqbzx9', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['warming', 'parental effects', 'germination responses', 'seed dormancy', 'size vs number trade-off', 'Fitness', 'phenotypic plasticity', 'Alpine environments'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rocco Notarnicola', 'givenName': 'Rocco', 'familyName': 'Notarnicola', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9860-6497', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Adrienne Nicotra', 'givenName': 'Adrienne', 'familyName': 'Nicotra', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Loeske Kruuk', 'givenName': 'Loeske', 'familyName': 'Kruuk', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01nrxwf90', 'name': 'University of Edinburgh'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pieter Arnold', 'givenName': 'Pieter', 'familyName': 'Arnold', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592', 'name': 'Australian National University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.np5hqbzx9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Consequently, plant species have acquired traits that allow them to resist and regenerate in an environment with recurrent fires. A key trait in fire-prone ecosystems is the age at first reproduction (maturity age); populations of non-resprouting species cannot persist when fire interval is shorter than this age. Maturity age is variable among individuals, so we hypothesize that short fire intervals select for early seed production (precocity). We selected 13 plots with different fire regimes in eastern Spain, all dominated by Pinus halepensis (a non-resprouting serotinous species). Then, we evaluated the age at first reproduction and the size of the canopy seed bank of each individual pine. Our results show a significant effect of fire regime on the onset of reproduction in this species, suggesting a selection towards higher precocity in populations subject to shorter fire intervals. Due to this higher precocity, pines stored more...', 'We selected 13 sites dominated by Pinus halepensis trees in the Valencia region (eastern Spain) across a range of altitudes and climatic conditions. In each site, we established 4 transects, spaced by at least 100 m. In each transect, we haphazardly selected and georeferenced 10 trees, separated by at least 10 m. For each tree, we measured its basal diameter (10 cm above ground) and the distance to the two closest trees. Then, we compute the annual growth rate as the basal diameter (cm) divided by the age (years) and the average of the distances to the 2 closest trees. Afterward, we estimated the age of each tree by counting whorls. For reproductive trees, we also estimated the age of each cone following the same method of counting whorls (avoiding immature cone cohorts; i.e., the last or last two cohorts depending on the sampling season) and recorded whether they were open (non-serotinous), closed (serotinous cones), or from the last cohort considered (closed but serotiny unknown).

This taxon concept was based on the name Salamandra auriculata Holbrook, 1838 with type locality Riceboro, Liberty County, Georgia and a type series that could not be located by later authors. Recent workers have been unable to locate or verify swamp-dwelling populations from east Texas and western Louisiana, which appear to be extirpated and may not have represented a distinct taxon from co-occurring lineages of D. conanti. Recent molecular phylogenies have supported at least four distinct species-level taxa within D. auriculatus. Populations from the Gulf Coastal Plain in eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and southwestern Alabama were recently described as D. valentinei Means, Lamb, and Bernardo, 2017 and D. pascagoula Pyron, O’Connell, Lamb, and Beamer, 2022.

In the associated paper, we tested a hypothesis that a central European forest land snail species survived in a northern refugium, which was proposed based on fossil finds indirectly dated to the Last Glacial Maximum and Late Glacial.

The purpose of this study was to use reanalysis and satellite data similar to those used in global and regional dust emission models to calculate the probability that a high wind event happens during the period that antecedent precipitation would have left the active layer wet. The results indicate that the answer to this question is more strongly related to regional climate than soil texture. For more than half of the globe with mean annual precipitation &lt; 500 mm/year, the probability of precipitation influencing dust emission is greater than 30 – 40%. Thus, rain-derived soil moisture in the active layer should not be ignored in models throughout much of the world’s dust-producing regions.', 'A global map of sand, silt, and clay fractions was derived from the global WISE v. 3.1 30 x 30 arcsec database which is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database [Batjes, 2016]. For each cell of this dataset, there are up to nine different soil components. For each cell, percent sand, silt and clay were derived by calculating the average of all available components, weighted by their fractional area in the cell. These average fractions were resampled to 0.25° x 0.25°, the same resolution as the precipitation data, and drying time was calculated using Equation 1.\\xa0\\nRavi et al. [2006] conducted experiments on six soils that provide estimates of the time it takes the active layer to dry (i.e., for a wet surface to return come into equilibrium with ambient relative humidity). A parameterization for these drying times (DTs) for soils based on soil texture data created by regressing DT against fractions of sand, silt, and clay:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DT (minutes) = 15.95 % Sand + 28.05 % Silt + 20....', 'Data are in TIFF/GeoTIFF Format and can be opened in standard image processing (for remote sensing data) or GIS (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) software.

We know, however, little about the physiology of this behaviour. Here we study how catecholaminergic hormones regulate rapid colour change in explosive breeding toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), where large groups of males gather and quickly change their colour from brown to bright yellow during reproduction. We find that both epinephrine (EP) and/or norepinephrine (NE) cause the toads’ skin to become yellow in minutes, even in the absence of social and environmental cues associated with explosive breeding. We hypothesize that natural selection drives the evolution of rapid colour change by co-opting the functional effects of catecholaminergic action. If so, then hormones involved in “fight or flight” responsivity may mechanistically facilitate the emergence of dynamic visual signals that mediate communication in a sexual context. ', 'On three separate experimental sessions, we examined the effect of EP and NE treatment on skin colouration. In each session, we randomly assigned 15 males to three different treatment groups (EP, NE, or control; n=5/group). We allowed four weeks to pass between sessions, as this time exceeds an adequate period that ensures all catecholamines have cleared from the toads’ circulation. Each experimental session consisted of two parts: (1) priming with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and (2) treatment with different catecholamines or saline solution (control). Before part 1, we measured the toads’ size (SVL, mm), weight (g) and back reflectance (baseline 1). Subsequently, we primed each toad with a single injection of 30 µl hCG (Sigma-Aldrich CG10-1VL; 20 IU/g bodyweight in saline solution) and placed them in their respective Fauna box (20x19x20 cm) for a period of five hours. hCG is a common exogenous reproductive hormone, widely used to induce reproduction and breeding behaviour in amp...', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.dbrv15f4b', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858746', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858747', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858748', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858749'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f4b', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Asian common toad', 'Duttaphrynus melanostictus', 'dynamic dichromatism', 'norepinephrine', 'vision model', 'Epinephrine'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Susanne Stückler', 'givenName': 'Susanne', 'familyName': 'Stückler', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1903-3171', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03prydq77', 'name': 'University of Vienna'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matthew Fuxjager', 'givenName': 'Matthew', 'familyName': 'Fuxjager', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/05gq02987', 'name': 'Brown University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Doris Preininger', 'givenName': 'Doris', 'familyName': 'Preininger', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03prydq77', 'name': 'University of Vienna'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.dbrv15f4b/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

We first apply standard methods to construct a binary phylogenetic tree and then use integer linear programming to compute optimal circular orderings that agree with all tree splits. This approach achieves an improved approximation of the input distance for the clear majority of experiments that we have run for simulated and real data. We release an implementation in R that can handle up to 94 taxa and usually needs about one minute on a standard computer for 80 taxa. For larger taxa sets, we include a top-down heuristic which also tends to perform better than Neighbor-net.', 'Two parts of data were used in our paper about Lpnet algorithm.\\nRandom matrix:\\n10000 distance matrixes for 30 taxa which use random numbers between 0 and 1 from the uniform distribution as pairwise distances. And then, we add the smallest constant to all distances to guarantee the triangle inequality in every distance matrix. We provide 10000 distance matrixes.\\nSimulation sequences:\\nWe randomly generate 10000 trees for 30 taxa by using the function sim.taxa from the R package TreeSimGM. We let the parameter waiting time until speciation for sim.taxa be exponentially distributed and normalize the maximum pairwise distance to 1 for every simulation tree. Then we use the software Dawg to simulate DNA sequences of length 10000bp from the simulation trees under Jukes-Cantor model. We provide origin simulation trees, distance matrixes, and simulation sequences.', 'We upload .txt files which can be opened with any text editor.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.51c59zwc3', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858192', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858194', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858201'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.51c59zwc3', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['phylogenetic networks', 'neighbor-net', 'integer linear programming', 'Circular split systems', 'Distance-based phylogenetics'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mengzhen Guo', 'givenName': 'Mengzhen', 'familyName': 'Guo', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-6330', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00rytkh49', 'name': 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Stefan Grünewald', 'givenName': 'Stefan', 'familyName': 'Grünewald', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00rytkh49', 'name': 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.51c59zwc3/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Nonetheless, information on microbial community assembly and assembly-driving processes in organic matter-polluted urban rivers remains elusive. In this study, a field study based on water and sediment samples collected from 200 organic matter-polluted urban rivers of 82 cities in China and Indonesia is combined with laboratory water-sediment column experiments. Our findings demonstrate a unique microbiome in these urban rivers. Among the community assembly-regulating factors, both organic matter and geographic conditions play major roles in determining prokaryotic and eukaryotic community assemblies, especially regarding the critical role of organic matter in regulating taxonomic composition. Using a dissimilarity-overlap approach, we found universality ...', 'To have a comprehensive insight into microbiomes of black-odorous urban rivers, 186 mediumly and highly polluted urban rivers of 78 cities in China (June to September 2018) were selected based on the cities’ black-odorous urban river number and the water quality criteria, including DOC, redox potential and SS (NURPG, 2015; MOHURD, 2018; Liang et al., 2021) (Figure S1). In addition, water and sediment samples from 14 highly polluted urban rivers in four cities in Indonesia (May 2019) were also collected to confirm the impact of variances in geography and pollution ingredients on the urban river microbiome (Figure S1). For each sampling location, water samples (500 ml) were collected from the middle layers of urban rivers, and surface sediment samples (approximately 200 g, top layer, &lt;30 cm) were acquired using a customized sediment sampler, as previously described (Liang et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021).

Historically these metapopulations persisted as relatively fluid networks, enabling gene flow between subpopulations and recolonization of formerly extirpated regions. However, over the past 45 years, Allegheny woodrat populations have experienced population declines throughout their range due to a combination of habitat destruction, declining hard mast availability, and roundworm parasitism. In an effort to initiate genetic rescue of a small, genetically depauperate subpopulation in New Jersey, woodrats were translocated from a genetically robust population in Pennsylvania (PA) in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Herein, we assess the efficacy of these translocations to restore genetic diversity within the recipient population.\\xa0\\nResults: We designed a novel 134 single nucleotide polymorphism panel, which was used to genotype the six woodrats translocated fro...', 'We extracted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a tail clip of a single N. magister individual by pairing commercially available extraction (DNEasy Blood and Tissue, Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands and clean-up (DNA clean &amp; Concentrator, Zymo Research, Irvine, California) kits in accord with the manufacturers’ instructions. We conducted three lanes of paired-end and one lane of mate-paired sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq2500. We used Trimmomatic to remove adaptors, discard short reads, and trim poor-quality bases from 5’ and 3’ ends of raw sequence reads. We used ABySS 1.9.0 to conduct several assemblies with kmer lengths ranging from 40 to 85. PE reads were used to generate contigs. MP reads were used to infer the order, orientation, and distance between contigs, linking them together in scaffolds. The assembly with the greatest N50 value and longest scaffold was used for downstream analyses.\\nWe used the MAKER 2.28 pipeline to annotate all scaffolds greater than 10 kb. We first use...', 'The Neotoma magister draft genome was generated from mate-paired and paired-end reads using ABySS vs. 1.9.0.\\xa0 The scaffolds greater than 10 kb in length are described in the 10000_kmer70_scaffolds_woodrats.fasta file.\\n21,151 genes were annotated in the N. magister genome.

While the environmental and biological ecosystem services provided by ecosystem-based adaptation measures such as beach nourishment and/or seagrass plantations are being acknowledged and analysed, less attention has been paid to the social or cultural dimensions of these services. This paper builds upon the emerging body of research that explores cultural ecosystem services in coastal areas and how they are perceived by the people who live, work and recreate in these areas. The aim of the paper is to take stock of and understand public and stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that may accrue through eelgrass (Zostera marina) restoration in tandem with beach nourishment in Southern Sweden. The empirical research is based on an online open-ended questionnaire in the coastal municipalities of Båstad, Trelleborg, Ystad and Kri...', 'Data was collected via a qualitative semi-structured, partly open survey to the residents and beachgoers in Båstad, Ystad, Trelleborg and Kristianstad from September to November 2019. We used an online survey method for data collection to understand stakeholder perceptions of the cultural ecosystem services that NbS such as eelgrass restoration and beach nourishment might provide. The survey targeted with residents from the four municipalities and a total of 99 responses were collected. The online questionnaire survey was published in several Facebook groups from these municipalities. All surveys were completely anonymous and were performed at the survey portal sogosurvey.com. Questions were developed to acquire information on the behaviour, knowledge, values, perceptions and feelings of people living, working and enjoying the case study coastal areas.\\nWe used discourse analysis to categorize responses from citizens for the first three dimensions as social functions (social activities a...', 'All qualitative data files are provided in PDF and provided in both the original Swedish and translation to English.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.ksn02v77s', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858368', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858369', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858370', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858371', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858372', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858373', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858375', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858376', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858377', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858378', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1858379'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ksn02v77s', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Cultural Ecosystem Services', 'Public Perceptions', 'values', 'coastal resilience', 'Climate Adaptation', 'nature-based solutions'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Lisa Van Well', 'givenName': 'Lisa', 'familyName': 'Van Well', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2066-5099', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02j2xmd27', 'name': 'Swedish Geotechnical Institute'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anelya Isayeva', 'givenName': 'Anelya', 'familyName': 'Isayeva', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79', 'name': 'Lund University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pål Axel Olsson', 'givenName': 'Pål Axel', 'familyName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79', 'name': 'Lund University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Johan Hollander', 'givenName': 'Johan', 'familyName': 'Hollander', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00v542r37', 'name': 'World Maritime University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.ksn02v77s/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

In other cases, rare species may be functionally redundant with common species and do not significantly contribute to phylogenetic diversity. How rare and common species coexist and contribute to local species pools may depend upon attributes of their communities and remains an open question in ecology. Niche differentiation has served as an explanation for species coexistence, and phylogenetic relatedness provides a means to approximate how ecologically similar species are to each other. To explore the contribution of rare species to community phylogenetic diversity, we sampled twenty-one plant communities\\xa0\\xa0across the Prairie Coteau ecoregion, home of the largest tracts of untilled northern tallgrass prairie and of high conservation concern.

Plant diversity can reduce the risk of plant disease, but positive, and neutral effects have also been reported. These contrasting relationships suggest that plant community composition, rather than diversity per se, affects disease risk. Here, we investigated how diversity and composition of plant communities drive root-associated pathogen accumulation belowground.\\n2. In a temperate grassland biodiversity experiment, containing 16 plant species (forbs and grasses), we determined the abundance of root-associated fungal pathogens in individual plant species growing in monocultures and in 4-species mixtures through Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing.\\n3. In the plant monocultures, we identified three major fungal pathogens that differed in host range: Paraphoma chrysanthemicola, associated with roots of forb species of the Asteraceae family, Slopeiomyces cylindrosporus, associated with grass species, and Rhizoctonia solani, associated with multiple forb and grass species.

Informed conservation and management of wildlife require sufficient monitoring to understand population dynamics and to direct conservation actions. Because resources available for monitoring are limited, conservation practitioners must strive to make monitoring as cost-effective as possible.\\n2. Our focus was on assessing the value of monitoring to the adaptive harvest management (AHM) program for pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the costs and benefits of a capture-mark-resight (CMR) program, a productivity survey, and biannual population censuses. Using all available data, we fit an integrated population model (IPM) and assumed that inference derived from it represented the benchmark against which reduced monitoring was to be judged. We then fit IPMs to reduced sets of monitoring data and compared their estimates of demographic parameters and expected management performance against the benchmark IPM.\\n3. Costs and the precision...', 'Population counts conducted in spring and autumn – Internationally coordinated population counts of pink-footed geese have been performed annually since 1990 in Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands in late October or early November (hereafter referred to as the November count) (Madsen et al., 1999). Over time, the population has expanded its distribution and the spatial coverage of the count has repeatedly been extended to capture new sites occupied by geese (Madsen, Christensen, Balsby, &amp; Tombre, 2015). Since 2005, the population has also been counted in Norway, and since 2016 in Sweden. Because of increasing challenges in monitoring the autumn population, an additional count was introduced in May in 2010, which includes Norway, Denmark, Sweden and, since 2016, Finland. The known sites are covered by a network of trained observers who coordinate the coverage. The May census costs €5,327 per year for academic staff salary and travel costs of volunteers.

Dieldrin resistance in Aedes albopictus is conferred by the alanine to serine substitution (A302S or RdlR allele) in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor encoded by the Rdl gene. On Reunion Island, dieldrin resistance was initially reported in natural Ae. albopictus populations sampled in 2008 despite the ban of dieldrin since 1994. To monitor insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus on the island and to identify its drivers, we measured (i) the frequency of resistance alleles in 19 distinct natural populations collected between 2016 and 2017, (ii) fitness costs associated with dieldrin resistance in laboratory-controlled experiments, and (iii) the resistance conferred by RdlR to fipronil, an insecticide widely used on the island and reported to cross-react with RdlR. The results show a persistence of RdlR in Ae. albopictus natural populations at low fr...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.8w9ghx3qt', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859081', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859082', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859083', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859084', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859085', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859086'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8w9ghx3qt', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['life history traits', 'Aedes albopictus', 'insecticide', 'Rdl', 'fitness costs', 'Reunion Island'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Yann Gomard', 'givenName': 'Yann', 'familyName': 'Gomard', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7700-9201', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Haoues Alout', 'givenName': 'Haoues', 'familyName': 'Alout', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/003vg9w96', 'name': 'National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Cyrille Lebon', 'givenName': 'Cyrille', 'familyName': 'Lebon', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Anne Latreille', 'givenName': 'Anne', 'familyName': 'Latreille', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aude Benlali', 'givenName': 'Aude', 'familyName': 'Benlali', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Patrick Mavingui', 'givenName': 'Patrick', 'familyName': 'Mavingui', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pablo Tortosa', 'givenName': 'Pablo', 'familyName': 'Tortosa', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Célestine Atyame', 'givenName': 'Célestine', 'familyName': 'Atyame', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/005ypkf75', 'name': 'University of La Réunion'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.8w9ghx3qt/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Some authors contend such divergence is concentrated along a single major axis of trait covariance, even if that axis does not lead populations directly toward fitness optimum. Other authors argue that divergence can occur readily along many phenotype axes at the same time. We use populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 14 lakes with contrasting ecological conditions to find some resolution along the continuum between these two extremes. Unlike many previous studies, we included several functional suites of traits (defensive, swimming, trophic) potentially subject to different sources of selection. We find that populations exhibit dimensionality of divergence that is high enough to preclude a history of constraint along a single axis – both for divergence in multivariate mean trai...', '', 'Please see README file'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862326', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862327', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862329', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862338', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862450', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862453', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1862454'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv41xw', 'version': 6, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grant Haines', 'givenName': 'Grant', 'familyName': 'Haines', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9085-0022', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/01pxwe438', 'name': 'McGill University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41xw/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Our results suggest that the P-cycling microbial community abundance and P availability respond positively to moderate increases in salinity by promoting the microbial solubilization and mineralization of soil P in brackish wetlands. Changes in microbial communities and microbially mediated P cycling may represent microbial strategies to adapt to moderate salinity levels, which in turn control soil function and nutrient balance.', 'The field experiments were conducted in the growing (July) and non-growing seasons (January) in both the freshwater and brackish C. malaccensis wetlands. Three 1 × 1 m quadrats (5 m apart) were randomly established at each site, and three soil cores (0–20 cm) were randomly collected in each quadrat and pooled into one sample. All samples were then stored in a portable refrigerator and immediately transported to the laboratory. The samples were homogenized and then split into two subsamples: one subsample was air-dried for the determination of P fractions and physicochemical parameters, and the other subsample was frozen at −80°C for DNA extraction. Plant biomasses were also collected during each season.\\nWe used the Hedley scheme of sequential extraction to estimate the fractions and availabilities of soil P (Hedley et al., 1982), which can effectively distinguish between Pi and Po. Briefly, soil samples were successively extracted using an anion-exchange resin (resin-P), 0.5 M NaHCO3 (N...', 'The dataset can be opened using regular Office software.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.41ns1rnj0', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1864862', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1864863'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.41ns1rnj0', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['P biogeochemistry', 'P-cycling genes', 'metagenomics', 'saltwater intrusion', 'coastal ecosystems'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Minjie Hu', 'givenName': 'Minjie', 'familyName': 'Hu', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9237-5138', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/020azk594', 'name': 'Fujian Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Yixun Le', 'givenName': 'Yixun', 'familyName': 'Le', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04kx2sy84', 'name': 'Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jordi Sardans', 'givenName': 'Jordi', 'familyName': 'Sardans', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72', 'name': 'Spanish National Research Council'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ruibing Yan', 'givenName': 'Ruibing', 'familyName': 'Yan', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/020azk594', 'name': 'Fujian Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Yi Zhong', 'givenName': 'Yi', 'familyName': 'Zhong', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/020azk594', 'name': 'Fujian Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Dongyao Sun', 'givenName': 'Dongyao', 'familyName': 'Sun', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04en8wb91', 'name': 'Suzhou University of Science and Technology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Chuan Tong', 'givenName': 'Chuan', 'familyName': 'Tong', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/020azk594', 'name': 'Fujian Normal University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Josep Peñuelas', 'givenName': 'Josep', 'familyName': 'Peñuelas', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72', 'name': 'Spanish National Research Council'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.41ns1rnj0/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

We measured metabolic rates of three representative marine invertebrate species (hermit crabs Pagurus hirsutiusculus, periwinkle snails Littorina sitkana, and mussels Mytilus trossulus) and evaluated the relationship between thermal sensitivity (Q10) and thermal history. We tested the hypothesis that thermal history drives thermal sensitivity and quantified how this relationship differs over time (short-term to seasonal time scales) and between species. Organisms were collected from tide pools in Sitka, Alaska where we also recorded temperatures to characterize thermal history prior to metabolic rate assays. Using respirometry, we estimated mass-specific oxygen consumption (MO2) at ambient and increased temperatures for one individual per species per tide pool across three seasons. We evaluated rel...', 'Temperature Data:Temperature data was collected at the tide pool level using Onset ® HOBO TidbiT temperature loggers (±0.2 accuracy) that recorded temperature consecutively every 5 min from December 2018 to September 2019. Temperature data were summarized for the 1-month, 1-week, and 1-day periods preceding each collection. For each tidepool, we calculated the following thermal parameters: variance, minimum, mean daily minimum, 10th percentile, range, mean daily range, mean daily average, maximum, mean daily maximum, 90th percentile, mean daily 90th percentile, 95th percentile, and mean daily 95th percentile temperatures.Oxygen Consumption Data:Raw Oxygen data was collected using Pre-Sens PSt3 sensor spots (PreSens Precision Sensing, Germany) and a 10-channel OXY-10 SMA (G2) oxygen meter (PreSens Precision Sensing, Germany).

Previous studies showed that bark cover at early-decay stage had profound control on the invertebrate assemblages of bark and wood, with possible consequence for the decomposition process. However, previous experimental designs could not disentangle how bark versus wood traits affect the invertebrate assemblage process in bark and/or wood separately because wood traits of different tree species may vary independently from bark traits. Furthermore, we do not know whether such tree species specific bark trait effects are still influential at mid-decay stage.\\n2. To unravel whether and how bark and wood traits influence invertebrate communities in tree logs at mid-decay stage, we introduce reciprocal bark transplantation within pairs of different tree species as a new method. We applied this method to two pairs of phylogenetically contrasting species of gymnosperms (pair I: Araucaria araucana and Cryptomeria japonica, pair II: Picea abies and Thuja plicata) and another gymnosperm (Chamae...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.7h44j0zxw', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863189', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863190', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863191'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7h44j0zxw', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Ecosystem function and services', 'design limitation', 'Gymnosperms', 'methodology', 'mid-decay stage', 'tree species specific', 'xylem'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Chenhui Chang', 'givenName': 'Chenhui', 'familyName': 'Chang', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4107-2065', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/02v51f717', 'name': 'Peking University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Matty Berg', 'givenName': 'Matty', 'familyName': 'Berg', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Richard van Logtestijn', 'givenName': 'Richard', 'familyName': 'van Logtestijn', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Juan Zuo', 'givenName': 'Juan', 'familyName': 'Zuo', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/034t30j35', 'name': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Li Lin', 'givenName': 'Li', 'familyName': 'Lin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04kx2sy84', 'name': 'Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Cynthia Bom', 'givenName': 'Cynthia', 'familyName': 'Bom', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jesper Wolters', 'givenName': 'Jesper', 'familyName': 'Wolters', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Maarten Biesbroeck', 'givenName': 'Maarten', 'familyName': 'Biesbroeck', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pepijn de Ruijter', 'givenName': 'Pepijn', 'familyName': 'de Ruijter', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mariet Hefting', 'givenName': 'Mariet', 'familyName': 'Hefting', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04pp8hn57', 'name': 'Utrecht University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ute Sass-Klaassen', 'givenName': 'Ute', 'familyName': 'Sass-Klaassen', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Wageningen University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Hans Cornelissen', 'givenName': 'Hans', 'familyName': 'Cornelissen', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/008xxew50', 'name': 'VU University Amsterdam'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.7h44j0zxw/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

For each of the 106 species we calculated the rate of change in mass, head and body length, wing length, and approximated relative surface area, over time and as a function of temperature anomaly (the difference between temperatures in a given year and the interannual average). We used phylogenetic mixed models (PGLMM) to determine trends and their relation to species’ ecology.\\nResults:\\xa0Over the last seventy years there have been consistent changes through time in mass, length, and s...', 'We initially gathered measurements of nearly 11,000 birds from the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, Tel Aviv University, collected between 1950 and 2020. These represent all birds for which either head and body length, wing length, or body mass data were present. Bird hunting is forbidden in Israel since the mid-1950s, and most specimens in the collection represent birds that were found dead, died in wildlife hospitals, or were confiscated by the authorities after being illegally hunted. Regardless of their source, birds were measured shortly after their death, and these measurements were taken by museum staff. \\xa0Because the specimens were collected and measured over several decades not all of them were measured by the same person, but new generations of museum personnel were taught by the previous ones, and used the same methods. We filtered the data to contain only adult birds, collected from the wild, in Israel. We only used species for which we had at least 30 specimens, collect...', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.j0zpc86g9', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1857443', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1857444'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j0zpc86g9', 'version': 7, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shahar Dubiner', 'givenName': 'Shahar', 'familyName': 'Dubiner', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1771-0087', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04mhzgx49', 'name': 'Tel Aviv University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shai Meiri', 'givenName': 'Shai', 'familyName': 'Meiri', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/04mhzgx49', 'name': 'Tel Aviv University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.j0zpc86g9/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13474', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

In this study, we i) identified predator species from scats through an established barcoding approach, and ii) explored the use of a cheap, quick barcoding method of fox feces (n = 103). We investigated differences in diet between the red fox (predicted generalist predator) and Arctic fox (predicted specialist predator) over two years with varying prey abundance. We amplified short DNA fragments (&lt; 200 bp) from small rodents, birds and hares. For both predators, there was a high frequency of occurrence of rodents (38 - 69 %) identifying them as primary prey species and birds as secondary prey species (13-31%). This demonstrates the strength of a straightforward DNA barcoding method for dietary analyses in sympatric fox predators, with species-level resolution of prey.

How the defenses interact to reduce predation risk is, however, poorly known. We used the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to investigate how morphological (spines) and behavioral (floating) defenses are integrated against a common predatory rotifer, Asplanchna brightwellii, and if their combined use improves survival. To this end, we assessed the cost of the behavioral defense and the efficiency of both defenses, individually and combined, as well as their mutual dependency. The results show that the behavioral defense is costly in reducing foraging activity, and that the two defenses are used simultaneously, with the presence of the morphological defense enhancing the use of the behavioral defense, as does the pre-exposure to predator cues. However, while the morphological defense reduces predation risk, the behavioral defense does not, thus, adding the costly behavioral defense to the morphological defense do...', 'the data is collected from four lab experiments.\\nFor details of the dataset please read our manscript \"Ineffective integration of multiple antipredator defenses in a rotifer: a low-cost insurance?\"\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0', 'the data is collected from four lab experiments.\\nFor details of the dataset please read our manscript \"Ineffective integration of multiple antipredator defenses in a rotifer: a low-cost insurance?\"'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.bvq83bkd2', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859870', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859895'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bvq83bkd2', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Behavioral defenses', 'Morphological defenses', 'phenotypic plasticity', 'predator-prey interactions', 'Predatory cues'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Yuhan He', 'givenName': 'Yuhan', 'familyName': 'He', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0352-2309', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/040af2s02', 'name': 'University of Helsinki'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Konghao Zhu', 'givenName': 'Konghao', 'familyName': 'Zhu', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b4mx203', 'name': 'Institute of Hydrobiology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kangshun Zhao', 'givenName': 'Kangshun', 'familyName': 'Zhao', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b4mx203', 'name': 'Institute of Hydrobiology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Liang He', 'givenName': 'Liang', 'familyName': 'He', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/042v6xz23', 'name': 'Nanchang University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ulrika Candolin', 'givenName': 'Ulrika', 'familyName': 'Candolin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/040af2s02', 'name': 'University of Helsinki'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jun Xu', 'givenName': 'Jun', 'familyName': 'Xu', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b4mx203', 'name': 'Institute of Hydrobiology'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Huan Zhang', 'givenName': 'Huan', 'familyName': 'Zhang', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00b4mx203', 'name': 'Institute of Hydrobiology'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.bvq83bkd2/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Analysing how and why lianas are distributed in forest canopies at landscape scales will help us determine the mechanisms driving changes in lianas over time. This will improve our understanding of liana ecology and projections of tropical forest carbon storage now and into the future. Despite competing hypotheses on the mechanisms driving spatial patterning of lianas, few studies have integrated multiple tree-level biotic and abiotic factors in an analytical framework. None have done so in the Palaeotropics, which are biogeographically and evolutionarily distinct from the Neotropics, where most research on lianas has been conducted.\\nWe used an unoccupied aerial system (UAS; drone) to assess liana load in 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia.

Leading hypotheses are forced interspecific copulations, mis-imprinting caused by mixed broods, and scarcity of conspecific mates. Using a large sample of hybrid ducks solicited from North American hunters we evaluated these hypotheses by genetically determining the mother and father species of F1 hybrids. Based on abundances in areas where their breeding ranges overlap, the frequency of hybrids varied greatly from expectations, with hybrids between species within recently derived clades being much more frequent than those between more divergent clades. Forced copulations, as measured by large phallus length asymmetries between parentals, strongly predicted the father species of most F1 hybrids.

Given the enormous amount of genetic information, scientists are able to perform mammoth tasks to improve the standard of health care such as determining genetic influences on outcome of allogeneic transplantation. Cloud-based computing has increasingly become a key choice for many scientists, engineers and institutions as it offers on-demand network access and users can conveniently rent rather than buy all required computing resources. With the positive advancements of cloud computing and nanopore sequencing data output, we were motivated to develop an automated and scalable analysis pipeline utilizing cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to accelerate HLA genotyping service and improve the efficiency of the workflow at lower cost.

Thanks to advances in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, a number of efficient ramp merging strategies have been developed. However, most of the existing CAV-based ramp merging strategies assume that all the vehicles are CAVs or do not differentiate vehicle type (i.e., passenger cars vs. heavy-duty trucks). In this study, we propose a decentralized cooperative ramp merging application for connected vehicles (both connected trucks and connected cars) in a mixed-traffic environment. In addition, we develop a multi-human-in-the-loop (MHuiL) simulation platform that integrates SUMO traffic simulator with two game engine-based driving simulators, allowing us to investigate the interactions between two human drivers under various traffic scenarios. The case study shows that the decentralized cooperative ramp merging application, which provides speed guidance to the con...', 'The dataset was collected from the custom-built multi-human-in-the-loop simulation platform by the research team.

For the hormone-receptor binding assay, recombinant PRL-L and GH were radioactively labelled with 125iodine and applied for determination of binding affinities with recombinant sea lamprey GH receptor and PRL receptor expressed by HEK293 cell line. Relative abundance of each gene in the cDNA samples synthesized upon the RNAs of various tissues of sea lamprey was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Semiquantification of immunoreactive staining in percent area of proximal pars distalis was conducted to compare the hormone levels in the pituitar...', 'Ligand-receptor binding assay: A binding assay was set up in a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube, containing 35-40 μg membrane proteins (PRLR-HEK, GHR-HEK or non-HEK) without or with unlabeled ligand (E. coli-produced, refolded rPRL-L or rGH) in a series of concentrations, ranging from 8 to 800 nM. Binding in the presence of 1000 nM unlabeled ligand was taken as nonspecific binding. Each binding ran in duplicate. Typically, 20,000 cpm of radioactive iodine (125I) labeled ligand was added to each tube in the final step. The binding was performed at 25 °C for 3 hours in water bath with gently shaking. The membrane proteins were collected at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation at 15, 000 g for 15 min, and tip of the tube containing the protein pellet was cut and transferred to gamma tube\\xa0for determination of bound radioactivity in Wizard Detector gamma counter (PerkinElmer).\\nReal-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis:\\xa0 The qPCR reaction (10 µl total volume) included SSoAdvanced Universal SYBR Gr...', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.jdfn2z3dr', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863639', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863640'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z3dr', 'version': 9, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['vertebrate evolution', 'osmoregulation', 'metamorphosis', 'Growth hormone', 'Prolactin'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ningping Gong', 'givenName': 'Ningping', 'familyName': 'Gong', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1514-8409', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/0405mnx93', 'name': 'Texas Tech University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Diogo Ferreira-Martins', 'givenName': 'Diogo', 'familyName': 'Ferreira-Martins', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/035a68863', 'name': 'United States Geological Survey'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jessica Norstog', 'givenName': 'Jessica', 'familyName': 'Norstog', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/035a68863', 'name': 'United States Geological Survey'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Stephen McCormick', 'givenName': 'Stephen', 'familyName': 'McCormick', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/035a68863', 'name': 'United States Geological Survey'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mark Sheridan', 'givenName': 'Mark', 'familyName': 'Sheridan', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/0405mnx93', 'name': 'Texas Tech University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.jdfn2z3dr/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2212196119', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

However, temporal changes in edge permeability, which may depend on the seasonal availability of resources in both matrix and native habitats, remain poorly understood. Here we tested how edge crossing behavior and the associated spillover of birds into sun coffee plantations respond to landscape structure and seasonality. We monitored the movement of six insectivorous understory bird species (four forest-specialists and two forest-generalists) using an automated telemetry system along a gradient of forest cover (7-60%) during two seasons (dry vs. wet) at nine sampling sites at the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We monitored 116 individuals and obtained a total of 15,129 bird detections across seasons. Bird resistance to crossing edges was strongly driven by an interaction between seasonality and forest cover in the surrounding landscape, with higher resistance to crossing edges along th...', \"The data upload here encompasses the data regarding 1) the number of detections of each marked individual across automated receptors (DetectionsAcross_AutomatedReceptors.xls), and 2) the Edge Resistance Index calculated for each species (EdgeResistanceIndex.xls). Details regarding data collection is in the session 'Material &amp; Methods' in the manuscript. The coordinates of the individual receptors can be made available upon reasonable request.

However, few studies have examined the influence of aging on social behavior. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are a socially monogamous and biparental rodent that live in small family groups and are now among the most popular rodent models for studies examining social behavior. Although the social behavioral trajectories of early-life development in prairie voles have been well-studied, how social behavior may change throughout adulthood remains unknown. Here we examined behavior in virgin male and female prairie voles in four different age groups: postnatal day (PND) 60–80, 140–160, 220–240, and 300–320. All animals underwent testing in a novel object task, a dominance test, a resident-intruder test, and several iterations of social approach and social interaction tests with varying types of social stimuli (i.e., novel same-sex conspecific, novel opposite-sex c...', 'Behavioral data was collected via video analysis in BORIS.', 'Excel'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3tx95x6k6', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859056', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859057', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859058', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859059', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859060', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859061', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859062'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3tx95x6k6', 'version': 2, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['social behavior', 'aging', 'aggression', 'voles'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jeanne Powell', 'givenName': 'Jeanne', 'familyName': 'Powell', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Madison Garvin', 'givenName': 'Madison', 'familyName': 'Garvin', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Nicholas Lee', 'givenName': 'Nicholas', 'familyName': 'Lee', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aubrey Kelly', 'givenName': 'Aubrey', 'familyName': 'Kelly', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6013-3943', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/03czfpz43', 'name': 'Emory University'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.3tx95x6k6/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Knowledge on their distribution and population dynamics increases our understanding of processes driving disease transmission. This is the first study using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) to elucidate the population genetic structure of the hermaphroditic snail Bulinus truncatus (Gastropoda, Heterobranchia) on a regional (17 to 150 km) and an inter-regional (1,000 – 5,400 km) scale. This snail species acts as an intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis, which cause human and animal schistosomiasis respectively. \\nMethods: Bulinus truncatus snails were collected in Senegal, Cameroon, Egypt and France and identified through DNA barcoding. A single-end Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) library, comprising of 87 snail specimens from the respective countries, was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped against S....', 'Samples of\\xa0B. truncatus\\xa0(numbers of specimens ranging from four to 16 per locality) were collected from 2011 to 2014 in Cameroon (one site, Cam_BAK), Senegal (four sites, Sen_DIAM, Sen_GUEC, Sen_MBO, Sen_NDO), Egypt (two sites, Egy_BEK, Egy_MAN) and France (one site, Cor_SUT).\\nA single-end GBS reduced representation library (RRL) was built and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center). The library was prepared by digesting DNA with EcoT22I, ligating P1 and P2 Illumina sequencing primers (the former including molecular identifiers for sequence demultiplexing) and Illumina adapters, before proceeding with titration and library enrichment. The choice of the restriction enzyme followed preliminary comparisons between EcoT22I and PstI on representatives of\\xa0B. truncatus.\\nHTS data processing\\nThe\\xa0HiSeq run produced 257x106\\xa0single-end raw reads of 101 bp.

Trinidadian killifish (Anablepsoides hartii) are found in sites that differ in predation intensity; fish that experience decreased predation and increased intraspecific competition exhibit larger brains. We evaluated the connection between brain size and fitness (survival and growth) when killifish are found in their native habitats and when fish are transplanted from sites with predators to high-competition sites that lack predators. Selection for a larger brain was absent within locally adapted populations. Conversely, there was a strong positive relationship between brain size and growth in transplanted but not resident fish in high-competition environments. We also observed significantly larger brain sizes in the transplanted fish that were recaptured at the end of the experiment versus those that were not. Our results provide experimental support that larger brains increase fitness and are favore...', 'The files include the data for the comparative mark-recapture experiments and the transplant experiment described in the manuscript.

We characterized natural variation in heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression among tissues and populations of free-living Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We focused on HSPs because they prevent cellular damage and promote recovery from heat stress. We used quantitative PCR to measure gene expression of three HSPs, including those in the HSP70 and HSP90 families that have robust experimental connections to heat in past literature. First, to evaluate how tissues and, by extension, the functions that they mediate, may vary in their thermal protection, we compared HSP gene expression among neural and peripheral tissues. We hypothesized that tissues with particularly vital functions would be more protected from heat as indicated by higher HSP gene expression. We found that brain tissues had consistently higher HSP gene expression compared to the pector...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.vhhmgqnwf', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863803', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863804', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1863810'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vhhmgqnwf', 'version': 4, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['Thermal tolerance', 'gene expression', 'heat shock protein', 'Populations', 'brain', 'ovary', 'muscle'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mary J.

Overall skull size decreased, along with increasing temperatures and decreasing soil moisture, which determined the availability of the shrews’ main food source, earthworms. The magnitude of Dehnel’s phenomenon increased over time, indicating an increasing selection pressure on animals in winter. Two files include the data on 1) the size of the skulls of Sorex araneus collected in the Białowieża Forest\\xa0 between 1953 and 2004; and 2) the meteorological data from Białowieża, from 1952 to 2004.', 'Skull measurements\\nSorex araneus were collected between 1953 and 2004 in Białowieża National Park, preserved in alcohol and stored in the zoological collection of the Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, in Białowieża. The skull height, length and width (mm) of 502 S. araneus were measured using X-ray images of the alcohol-preserved specimens, as described by Lázaro et al.

However, a mismatch may lead to different capacities for providing climatic refuge to dispersing species. We compiled community data on zooplankton, ectothermic animals that form the consumer basis of most aquatic food webs, from over 1,200 mountain lakes and ponds across western North America to assess biodiversity along geographic temperature gradients spanning nearly 3,750 metres of elevation and 30 degrees latitude. Species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and functional diversity all showed contrasting responses across gradients, with richness metrics plateauing at low elevations but exhibiting intermediate latitudinal maxima. The nonmonotonic/hump-shaped diversity trends with latitude emerged from geographic interactions, including weaker latitudinal relationships at higher elevations...', 'Records of zooplankton occurrence over a 52-year period (1964 to 2015) were compiled from multiple sources, including published articles, technical reports, and government datasets (previously described by Loewen et al., 2019).\\nData were standardized to reflect current taxonomy as per Appendix S1 of Loewen et al., (2019), and 119 taxa (identified to genus to higher) were retained analysis.\\nREFERENCES\\nLoewen, C.J.G., Strecker, A.L., Larson, G.L., Vogel, A., Fischer, J.M., &amp; Vinebrooke, R.D.

Climate change is altering both dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties and phytoplankton dynamics in lakes. High-altitude lakes are good sentinels of global change. However, their value as sentinels depends on how well we understand their functioning. This study analyzed physical, chemical, and biological data during three pre-defined periods running from complete ice-cover right to the end of the ice-free season, in a high-altitude oligotrophic lake. A functional approach was used to assess how relationships between DOM and the planktonic community vary over time.\\n2. Phytoplankton functional change was found to occur with shifts in dissolved organic matter. During the ice-influenced period, from February to the end of the thaw, the phytoplankton community was dominated by small autotrophs and mixotrophic flagellates and DOM from sediment and terrestrial origin dominated the DOM pool of the lake.

However, a molecular dissection of their effect on females is rare. In decorated crickets, the male’s nuptial gift comprises part of the male’s spermatophore, the spermatophylax, which functions to deter the female from prematurely removing the sperm-containing portion, the ampulla, from her genital opening. However, ingested spermatophylax compounds and proteins contained in the ampulla could also influence female physiology and behavior to the male’s benefit. We investigated how mating per se and these two distinct routes of potential male-mediated manipulation influence the transcriptional response of females. We conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment on the gut and head tissue from females for whom consumption of nuptial food gifts and receipt of an ejaculate had been independently manipulated. In the gut tissue, we found that females not permitt...', 'Transcriptomes were assembled with Trinity and sare deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the bioproject PRJNA784797.\\xa0\\nThey were annotated using the Trinotate pipeline.

Many of these processes are linked to nutrient-sensing signaling pathways, suggesting that diet plays a critical role in the aging process. In fact, the protein content in the diet can affect both longevity and fecundity, but often in opposite directions. Indeed, in many solitary organisms, a protein-rich diet dramatically shortens lifespan but increases egg production. We used the ant Temnothorax rugatulus to investigate the effect of the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the diet on the survival and fecundity of fertile workers. We fed colonies either a moderately high-protein or high-carbohydrate diet (2:1 and 1:2 respectively) and monitored worker survival and egg production over nine weeks. The protein-rich diet did not alter the ability of workers to lay eggs, but reduced worker survival, suggesting ...', '', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41zv', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859481', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859482', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859485'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv41zv', 'version': 10, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marina Choppin', 'givenName': 'Marina', 'familyName': 'Choppin', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3124-5049', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/019whta54', 'name': 'University of Lausanne'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.v15dv41zv/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision.\\xa0 However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. A mouse model of rod degeneration was used to investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression. Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher an...', 'Raw image files used to create Figure 1.', 'FIJI, ImageJ, or NIS elements.'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.x95x69pmq', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814848', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814849', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814850', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814851', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814852', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814853', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814854', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814855', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814856', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814857', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814858', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814859', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814860', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814861', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814862', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814863', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814864', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814865', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814866', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1814867'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.x95x69pmq', 'version': 5, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Miranda Scalabrino', 'givenName': 'Miranda', 'familyName': 'Scalabrino', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0158-5170', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00py81415', 'name': 'Duke University'}}, 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.x95x69pmq/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2022', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80271', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

Here, we present devCellPy a highly accurate and precise machine learning-enabled tool that enables automated prediction of cell types across complex annotation hierarchies. To demonstrate the power of devCellPy, we construct a murine cardiac developmental atlas from published datasets encompassing 104,199 cells from E6.5-E16.5 and train devCellPy to generate a cardiac prediction algorithm. Using this algorithm, we observe a high prediction accuracy (>90%) across multiple layers of annotation and across de novo murine developmental data. Furthermore, we conduct a cross-species prediction of cardiomyocyte subtypes from in vitro-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells and unexpectedly uncover a predominance of left ventricular (LV) identity that we confirmed by an LV-specific TBX5 lineage tracing system. Together, our results show devCellPy to be a useful tool for automated cell prediction across complex cellular hierarchies, species, and experimental systems. A major informatic challenge in single cell RNA-sequencing analysis is the precise annotation of datasets where cells exhibit complex multilayered identities or transitory states. Here the authors present devCellPy, a Python-based package that enables the automated prediction of cell types across complex cellular hierarchies, species, and experimental systems with high accuracy, particularly for developmental scRNA-seq datasets.', 'datePublished': '2022-09-07', 'dateModified': '2022-09-07', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '20', 'license':

To overcome this problem, we extended the widely used framework of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratios and developed the novel metric ωC, which measures the error-corrected convergence rate of protein evolution. While ωC distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes.

Smoke-responsive germination is a common trait in seeds in fire-prone ecosystems but has not been demonstrated in bryophyte spores. To investigate the potential role of smoke in post-fire peatland recovery, we tested the germination of spores of fifteen bryophyte species after treatment with smoke-water. Comparison of smoke responsiveness between spores of different laboratory storage times and burial depths/age (3-200 yrs old) were subsequently tested. Smoke increased germination percentage for 10 of the 15 study species, and increased germination speed for four of these. Smoke responsiveness increased along the fire frequency gradient from open expanse to forest margin, consistent with the theory that this selects for the maintenance of fire-adapted traits.

An informatics framework was developed for phylogeny-based integration of these data and prediction of traits for any subject barcodes, and compared to two Blast-based methods of trait assignment.\\xa0\\nUnder the specimen-level dataset, rate and accuracy of trait assigned dropped with an increase in distance between the query and its nearest reference member, though phylogenetic assignment was found to perform best under several criteria.

Clarifying the role of construction behavior on a macroevolutionary scale is crucial to interpreting phenotypic evolution. Spiders, an extremely successful group of animals exhibiting a wide variety of functional, morphological, and behavioral diversity, are ideal candidates to test whether animal behaviors are related to their phenotypic evolution. Herein, we reconstructed the phylogenomic relationships of 303 spiders covering 105 families with 99 newly developed molecular markers that universally apply across Araneae, and explicitly tested the potential link between construction behavior and somatic evolution based on extensive morphological data from 3,342 extant species and 682 fossil species. Our dated molecular phylogeny provides the backbone for analyses, revealing the behavioral and ecological processes behind these spiders’ morphological adaptations.

To elucidate the population genetic structure of this species, 1633 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 18 microsatellite markers (SSRs) were used to genotype samples from 27 sites representing 18 geographical populations distributed throughout the known range of the species in East Asia. Analyses of both SNPs and SSRs showed that M. onukii populations in Yunnan exhibit high genetic differentiation and structure compared to other populations.

One commonly studied contrast is the difference in eye structure between nocturnal and diurnal species, with nocturnal species typically having features that enhance eye sensitivity such as larger eyes, larger eye facets, and larger ocelli. In this study, we compared eye structure between workers of closely related nocturnal and diurnal above-ground foraging ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in four genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax, Veromessor). In all four genera, nocturnal species tend to have little cuticular pigment (pale), while diurnal species are heavily pigmented (dark), hence we could use cuticle coloration as a surrogate for activity pattern. Across three genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax), pale species, as expected for nocturnally active animals, had larger eyes, larger facet diameters, and larger visual sp...', '', 'All data are in SPSS.\\xa0 If using a free software alternative to SPSS like JASP, please note that some cells may appear empty.

Most theories on sex ratio manipulation focus on maternal strategies and sex-biased maternal allocation. Recent studies report paternal influences on both offspring sex ratio and post-partum sex-biased maternal allocation. We used long-term data on marked kangaroos to investigate if and how paternal mass and skeletal size, both determinants of male reproductive success, influenced (a) offspring sex in interaction with maternal mass, and (b) post-partum sex-biased maternal allocation. When mothers were light, the probability of having a son increased with paternal mass. Heavy mothers showed the opposite trend. A similar result emerged when considering paternal size instead of mass. Post-partum maternal sex-specific allocation was independent of paternal mass or size. Studies of offspring sex manipulation or maternal allocation would benefit from an explicit ...', 'Data collection and processing is described in the paper.', 'Notes on data files and R scripts can be found in the file README.txt'], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.76hdr7sx1', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859606', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859607', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859608', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859609', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859610', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1859611'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.76hdr7sx1', 'version': 7, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': [], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Luca Montana', 'givenName': 'Luca', 'familyName': 'Montana', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00kybxq39', 'name': 'Université de Sherbrooke'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pauline Toni', 'givenName': 'Pauline', 'familyName': 'Toni', 'sameAs': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4545-1924', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00kybxq39', 'name': 'Université de Sherbrooke'}}, {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marco Festa-Bianchet', 'givenName': 'Marco', 'familyName': 'Festa-Bianchet', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'Organization', 'sameAs': 'https://ror.org/00kybxq39', 'name': 'Université de Sherbrooke'}}], 'distribution': {'@type': 'DataDownload', 'encodingFormat': 'application/zip', 'contentUrl': 'http://datadryad.org/api/v2/datasets/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.76hdr7sx1/download'}, 'temporalCoverage': '2021', 'spatialCoverage': [], 'citation': 'http://doi.org/10.1086/721437', 'license': {'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication', 'license': 'https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'}, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'legalName': 'Dryad Digital Repository', 'name': 'Dryad', 'url': 'https://datadryad.org'}, 'provider': {'@id': 'https://datadryad.org'}}\n"

However, they currently account for 30-50% of the global river network, and that number is rising due to anthropogenic water extraction, land-use change, and climate change. We explored the Coleoptera biodiversity of the south Pacific-coast region of British Columbia, Canada, using pitfall traps at perennial and naturally-intermittent stream reaches, in shoreline, dry streambed, and riparian habitats, in both flowing (spring/early summer) and non-flowing (late summer) phases. We found that habitats around perennial reaches had significantly greater abundance of Coleoptera than those around intermittent reaches. However, neither habitat type nor flow regime were significant predictors of taxon richness, and intermittent stream sites featured unique taxa that were not found near perennial streams. This aligns with recent results from other taxonomic...', 'The dataset was collected in 2021 around four stream reaches in coastal British Columbia. Each row of data represents a pooled sample comprising six pitfall traps. Traps were deployed in either riparian habitat around the streams, or on the streambank (for flowing streams) or streambed (for dry streams), for an average of seven days per deployment period. Coleoptera individuals were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level in the laboratory, using a microscope, species identification keys, and species lists from relevant areas. At the same time that pitfall traps were deployed, soil samples were collected from the same locations. Soil moisture was calculated by weighing soil samples before and after drying them in an oven, and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) was calculated after combusting subsamples of soil in a muffle furnace.', ''], 'url': 'http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.rfj6q57f5', 'contentUrl': ['http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1864149', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1864152', 'http://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/1864153'], 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rfj6q57f5', 'version': 3, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'keywords': ['pitfall trap', 'coleoptera', 'riparian zone', 'intermittent streams'], 'creator': [{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Chelsea J.

We quantified wolverine (Gulo gulo) population trends from 2011 to 2020 in &gt;14 000 km2 protected and non-protected habitat in southwestern Canada. We conducted wolverine and multi-species surveys using non-invasive DNA and remote camera-based methods. We developed Bayesian integrated models combining spatial capture-recapture data of marked and unmarked individuals with occupancy data. Wolverine density and occupancy declined by 39 percent, with an annual population growth rate of 0.925. Density within protected areas was 3 times higher than outside and declined between 2011 (3.6 wolverines/1000 km2) and 2020 (2.1 wolverines/1000 km2).
