Duodenal atresia and absent thymus were also reported. So far, it has been described in four unrelated infants identified through a congenital malformation screening program carried out in Spain. The prevalence was estimated at around 1 in 330,000. The etiology is unknown but it was suggested that the syndrome is caused by defective expression of a developmental control gene." ;
