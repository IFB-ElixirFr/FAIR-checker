        ns1:description "A rare genetic interstitial lung disease characterized by diffuse lung disease of variable phenotype ranging from severe respiratory insufficiency in infancy to asymptomatic adults, due to surfactant protein C deficiency. Typical presentation in infancy includes dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and gradual cyanosis, with or without failure to thrive. Radiological findings include diffuse ground-glass opacities in neonates, later interstitial thickening associated with lung hyperinflation, intraparenchymal/subpleural cysts, honeycombing, subpleural nodules, or bronchiectasis. Infiltrates and air leaks are frequent complications." ;
