        ns1:description "A rare primary germ cell tumor of central nervous system characterized by a lesion typically in the region of the pineal gland and the suprasellar compartment, composed of cytotrophoblastic elements and multinucleated syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells. Ectatic stromal vascular channels, blood lakes, and extensive hemorrhagic necrosis are the rule. The tumor usually arises in the second decade of life and predominantly in males. Clinical presentation depends on location and size and includes signs of increased intracranial pressure, visual disturbances, and endocrine abnormalities. Prognosis is generally poor." ;
