        ns1:description "An intermediate form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis spectrum characterized by destruction and detachment of the skin epithelium, involving between 10 to 29% of the body surface area, and mucous membranes. Onset usually occurs 4-28 days after administration of the causal medication and is most frequently associated with anticonvulsants, antibacterial sulfonamides, allopurinol, nevirapine, and oxicams (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), but many other medications have also been implicated. The disease is not induced by medication in 15% of cases. Histology is characterized by an epidermal necrolysis. Multiple disabling long-term sequelae (especially cutaneous, ocular and psychological) are frequent." ;
