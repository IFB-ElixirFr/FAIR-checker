        ns1:description "A group of rare lymphatic malformation disorders characterized by solitary or multifocal, benign, congenital malformation of the lymphatic vessels in the soft tissues, resulting in painless cystic lesions, which are predominantly found in the head and neck (but may affect any site), and which have varying clinical presentation depending on specific size and location of lesion. Categorization into macrocystic lympathic malformations, microcystic lymphatic malformations or mixed cystic lymphatic malformations is reported based on the size of the cyst(s) contained within the lesion. Functional deficits and compromise of vital functions (including breathing, feeding) may be observed." ;
