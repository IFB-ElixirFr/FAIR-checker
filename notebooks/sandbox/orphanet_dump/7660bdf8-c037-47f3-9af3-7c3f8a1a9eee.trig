        ns1:description "A rare genetic primary lymphedema characterized by uniform, widespread lymphedema, often with systemic involvement such as intestinal and pulmonary lymphangiectasia, pleural and pericardial effusions, and chylothorax. There is a high incidence of non-immune hydrops fetalis, which may result in fetal demise or fully resolve after birth. Severe, recurrent facial cellulitis is observed in some patients. Presence of epicanthic folds or micrognathia has occasionally been reported, while intelligence is normal, and seizures are absent." ;
