Affected bones include the femoral head, talus, vertebral body, humerus, and scaphoid, among others. Patients may initially be asymptomatic but subsequently present with gradually developing refractory pain, swelling, and reduced range of motion. If left untreated, the condition may progress to bone collapse with secondary degeneration, fragmentation, and pathological fracture, as well as osteoarthritis." ;
