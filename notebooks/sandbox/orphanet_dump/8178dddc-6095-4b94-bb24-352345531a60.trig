        ns1:description "A rare systemic condition affecting patients undergoing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and characterized by a systemic inflammatory response due to massive activation of leukocytes with subsequent cytokine release. It can present with a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms (such as fever, fatigue, headache, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia) to severe life-threatening manifestations including vascular leakage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and multiple organ failure. Respiratory manifestations are common and range from cough and tachypnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)." ;
