        ns1:description "A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by mostly posterior, less frequently also anterior or lateral dislocation of the radial head from its position in the humeroradial joint. It is bilateral in the majority of cases and can occur as an isolated feature or in association with other congenital malformations and as part of a number of syndromes. The defect may at first cause only mild symptoms such as pain and limitation of flexion of the elbow, but may eventually lead to joint instability, dysplastic changes of the radial head, and arthritis." ;
