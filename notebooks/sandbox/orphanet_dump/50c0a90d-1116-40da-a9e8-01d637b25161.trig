Additional features are neck flexor weakness, foot extensor weakness, and, in rare cases, mildly impaired cardiac function. Muscle biopsy shows eosinophilic myofibrillar inclusions referred to as cytoplasmic bodies, as well as fiber size variation, increased internal nuclei and connective tissue, fiber splitting, and rimmed vacuoles." ;
