        ns1:description "A rare biliary tract disease characterized by loss of interlobular bile ducts resulting in chronic cholestasis, without any known cause. Loss of less than 50% of interlobular bile ducts is associated with a mild disease course, while loss of the majority of ducts results in a severe form, potentially leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients typically present as young or middle-aged adults with episodic jaundice, pruritus, and elevated liver enzymes." ;
