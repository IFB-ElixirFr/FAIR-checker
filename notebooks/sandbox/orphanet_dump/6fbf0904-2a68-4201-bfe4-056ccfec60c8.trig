Additional manifestations include variable auto-inflammatory symptoms such as uveitis, arthritis, skin abscesses, erythema nodosum, and nephritis. Neurological involvement is rare and lymphoma is never observed. Laboratory findings include normal or increased activated T cells, low or normal iNKT cells, and normal or reduced memory B cells." ;
