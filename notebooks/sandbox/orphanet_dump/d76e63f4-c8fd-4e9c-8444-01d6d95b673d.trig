According to the association with preceding or underlying conditions, three types can be distinguished: type 1 usually follows a febrile infection, type 2 is associated with paraproteinemia, and type 3 occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. Especially in types 2 and 3, extracutaneous involvement may be present. Other potentially associated conditions include a variety of endocrinopathies, systemic diseases, and neoplasms." ;
