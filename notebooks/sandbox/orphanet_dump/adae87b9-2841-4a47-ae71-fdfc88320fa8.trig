        ns1:description "A rare skin disease characterized by widespread cutaneous telangiectases usually &#64257;rst appearing on the lower limbs and slowly progressing upwards to involve the trunk and arms. The lesions can be diffuse, localized, macular, plaque-like, discrete, or con&#64258;uent. Recurrent bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes is not a common feature. Likewise, co-existing epidermal or dermal abnormalities, like atrophy, depigmentation, or purpura, are absent. The condition is non-hereditary, and to establish the diagnosis, other primary and secondary telangiectases must be excluded." ;
