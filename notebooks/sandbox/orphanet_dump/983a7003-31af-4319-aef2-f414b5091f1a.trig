Patients present with prolonged attacks which last for approximately two to five days and may include nonpitting edema of the skin, severe abdominal symptoms such as pain and swelling, and/or respiratory distress due to upper respiratory airways involvement. Affected locations and frequency of attacks differ slightly between subtypes. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and pregnancy are precipitating factors, especially in patients with a factor XII mutation." ;
