        ns1:description "A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by early-onset progressive bone marrow failure with anemia, leukopenia, mild thrombopenia, and myelodysplastic features, as well as non-hematologic manifestations, such as developmental delay, cataracts, facial dysmorphism, short stature, and skeletal anomalies. Immunodeficiency primarily affects B-cells and may lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Additional reported features include dry skin and eczema, cardiac anomalies, hearing loss, and reduction of cerebral volume on brain imaging." ;
