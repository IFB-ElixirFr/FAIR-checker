The valves may be located anywhere distal to the membranous urethra. Clinical presentation is highly variable, depending on age and degree of urinary obstruction, and includes urinary incontinence, urinary retention, weak urinary stream, post-micturitional dribbling, bulging on the ventral penis, urinary tract infection, and urosepsis." ;
