        ns1:description "A rare primary organ-specific lymphoma characterized by primary origin in the thyroid gland, sometimes involving cervical lymph nodes, and infrequently more distant sites. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is most common, followed by MALT lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. More rare types include T-cell lymphomas, Burkitt lymphoma, or classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The condition is usually associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients typically present with a mass in the thyroid, with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Hoarseness and dyspnea may occur, while constitutional symptoms are rare. Prognosis is favorable for patients with localized tumors." ;
